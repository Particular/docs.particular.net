## Installing the License from ServiceInsight

If your license has expired, a dialog box will display when you launch ServiceInsight:

![trial period expiration](images/trial-period-expiration.png)

The license can be loaded by clicking the "Manage License..." button and selecting the license file.

You can also import a new license file by going to the "Help" menu and selecting "Manage License".

In either case, a dialog box will appear allowing you to "Import license file...".

Once a license is loaded, the dialog box will display a success message like the following:

![trial period licensed](images/trial-period-licensed.png)

## Installing the License from ServiceControl

See the [ServiceControl licensing page](/servicecontrol/license.md) for more information.

## Verifying the license is loaded

ServiceInsight displays licensing information in the status bar (bottom right hand side):

![license verified](images/license-verified.png 'width=500')
