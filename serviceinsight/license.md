To register ServiceInsight, before or after the trial period is over, click on "Help" \> "Register" menu item. Running ServiceInsight after the trial period is expired, the following dialog will be displayed:

The license can be loaded by clicking the "Browse..." button and selecting the license file. The dialog box will then display the following confirmation message:

### Verifying a license is applied

Once the license file is loaded, ServiceInsight will then display licensing information on its status bar (bottom right hand side) upon launch:
