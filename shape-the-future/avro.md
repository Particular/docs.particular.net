[Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) is a compact, fast, binary data serialization framework with strong schema evolution capabilities, making it ideal for exchanging messages between systems in a consistent, language-agnostic way.

We've created a [sample to showcase the serializer](/samples/serializers/avro/).

Avro isn't currently a supported serializer in the platform, but we're looking to gain more information about your usage scenarios.
Please tell us more about [your Avro use cases](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/7397).
