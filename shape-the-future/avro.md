[Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) is a compact, fast, binary data serialization framework with strong schema evolution capabilities, making it ideal for exchanging messages between systems in a consistent, language-agnostic way.

We've created a [sample to showcase the serializer](/samples/serializers/avro/).

While Avro isn’t officially supported in the platform yet, we’re exploring the possibilities - and your input can help shape the future. We’d love to hear how you’re using Avro and what would make it valuable for you. [Share your use cases](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/7397) and join the conversation.
