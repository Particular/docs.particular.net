[AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com) is an open-source specification that provides a standard way to define:

- Event-driven services
- Message brokers
- Topics, channels, and event payloads

It makes it easier to document, understand, visualize, and generate code for message-based systems.

Have a look at the two AsyncAPI samples to see how it can be used with NServiceBus.

- [Simple AsyncAPI sample](/samples/asyncapi/simple/)
- [AsyncAPI with custom message conventions sample](/samples/asyncapi/custom-message-types/)

AsyncAPI isn't currently a supported feature in the platform, but we're looking to gain more information about your usage scenarios.
Please tell us more about [your AsyncAPI use cases](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/7398).
