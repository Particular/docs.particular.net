## Scenario

This sample was created as part of a [demo](https://youtu.be/83UYne9LjZk) showcasing the ease with which a distributed system can be created using the [Particular dotnet new Templates](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates/).

The scenario for the solution is to keep track of ticket sales at cinemas and feature the film with the most tickets sold for the current month.

    Customer->>+Cinema (Ticket Sales): Purchase Ticket
    Cinema (Ticket Sales)->>+Cinema Headquarters: RecordTicketSale
    Cinema Headquarters-->>-Cinema (Ticket Sales): FeaturedFilmChanged
```

## Running the sample

1. Run the solution. Two console applications will start.
2. In the Ticket Sales application, press B or O to sell a ticket for one of the two films.
3. In the Headquarters application, monitor the logs to see which film has the most sales.
4. In the Ticket Sales application, monitor the logs to see when the featured film changes.

### TicketSales project

The Cinema.TicketSales project provides a console interface to sell tickets for two films. These ticket sales are reported to the Headquarters endpoint by sending a `RecordTicketSale` message.
