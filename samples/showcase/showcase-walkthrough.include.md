## Walk-through

Users can order products from the website. Once orders are submitted, there is a window of time allocated for handling cancellations due to buyer's remorse. Once the order has been accepted, it is provisioned and made available for download. 


### Sales

The web application hosts the ECommerce endpoint. When a user presses <kbd>Place Order</kbd> on the website, the ECommerce endpoint sends a `SubmitOrder` command to the Sales endpoint. Upon receiving a `SubmitOrder` command the Sales endpoint will immediately publish an `OrderPlaced` event with a request to be called back in 20 seconds (`BuyersRemorseIsOver`). If the user does not cancel the order before the end of the buyer's remorse period, the Sales endpoint will publish an `OrderAccepted` event.

The ECommerce endpoint subscribes to the `OrderPlaced` and `OrderAccepted` events in order to update the web page. It does this by forwarding events to the client using SignalR.

```mermaid
graph LR

  subgraph Sales
    web(ECommerce)
    sales(Sales)
    web --> SubmitOrder 
    sales --> BuyersRemorseIsOver["fa:fa-bell-o BuyersRemorseIsOver"]
    BuyersRemorseIsOver --> sales
  SubmitOrder --> sales
  end
    
  sales -.-> OrderPlaced
  OrderPlaced -.-> web

  sales -.-> OrderAccepted
  OrderAccepted -.-> web  
  
  classDef message fill:#ffe4c2;
  classDef event fill:#ffe4c2,stroke-dasharray: 2,2;

  class SubmitOrder,BuyersRemorseIsOver message;
  class OrderPlaced,OrderAccepted event;
```

If the user presses <kbd>Cancel</kbd> before the buyer's remorse period ends, the ECommerce endpoint sends a `CancelOrder` command to the Sales endpoint which publishes an `OrderCancelled` event instead of an `OrderAccepted` event. The ECommerce endpoint subscribes to `OrderCancelled` and updates the UI via SignalR to mark the order as cancelled.

```mermaid
graph LR

  subgraph Sales
    web(ECommerce)
    sales(Sales)
    web --> SubmitOrder 
    web --> CancelOrder
    sales --> BuyersRemorseIsOver["fa:fa-bell-o BuyersRemorseIsOver"]
    BuyersRemorseIsOver --> sales
    SubmitOrder --> sales
    CancelOrder --> sales
  end
    
  sales -.-> OrderPlaced
  OrderPlaced -.-> web

  sales -.-> OrderCancelled
  OrderCancelled -.-> web  
  
  classDef message fill:#ffe4c2;
  classDef event fill:#ffe4c2,stroke-dasharray: 2,2;

  class SubmitOrder,BuyersRemorseIsOver message;
  class OrderPlaced,OrderCancelled event;
```


### Provisioning

Once an order is accepted, it can be provisioned. The ContentManagement endpoint subscribes to the `OrderAccepted` event and sends a `ProvisionDownloadRequest` message to the Operations endpoint. When Operations handles `ProvisionDownloadRequest` it responds with a `ProvisionDownloadResponse` message. When the response is received by ContentManagement it publishes a `DownloadIsReady` event. The ECommerce endpoint subscribes to `DownloadIsReady` to update the UI via SignalR.

```mermaid
graph LR

  subgraph Sales
    web(ECommerce)
    sales(Sales)
  end
    
  sales -.-> OrderAccepted
  OrderAccepted -.-> web  

  subgraph Provisioning
    contentManagement(ContentManagement)
    operations(Operations)
    contentManagement --> ProvisionDownloadRequest
    ProvisionDownloadRequest --> operations
    operations --> ProvisionDownloadResponse
    ProvisionDownloadResponse --> contentManagement
  end

  OrderAccepted -.-> contentManagement

  contentManagement -.-> DownloadIsReady
  DownloadIsReady -.-> web

  classDef message fill:#ffe4c2;
  classDef event fill:#ffe4c2,stroke-dasharray: 2,2;

  class ProvisionDownloadRequest,ProvisionDownloadResponse message;
  class OrderAccepted,DownloadIsReady event;
```


### CustomerRelations

The CustomerRelations endpoint subscribes to `OrderAccepted` events. When a customer order is accepted, the CustomerRelations endpoint publishes a `ClientBecamePreferred` event. This event has only one subscriber, CustomerRelations itself, which will use send the customer a welcome pack and a limited time offer when a customer becomes preferred.

```mermaid
graph LR

  subgraph Sales
    sales(Sales)
  end

  sales -.-> OrderAccepted
  OrderAccepted -.-> customerRelations

  subgraph Customer Relations
    customerRelations(CustomerRelations)
  end

  customerRelations -.-> ClientBecamePreferred
  ClientBecamePreferred -.-> customerRelations

  classDef event fill:#ffe4c2,stroke-dasharray: 2,2;

  class OrderAccepted,ClientBecamePreferred event;
```
