The handler class is automatically discovered by NServiceBus because it implements the `IHandleMessages<T>` interface. The [dependency injection system](/nservicebus/containers/) (which supports constructor or property injection) injects the `IBus` instance into the handler to access messaging operations. When a `PlaceOrder` command is received, NServiceBus will create a new instance of the `PlaceOrderHandler` class and invoke the `Handle` method.
