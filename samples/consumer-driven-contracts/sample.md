## Introduction to consumer-driven contracts

This sample shows a [consumer-driven contract](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html)(CDC) approach to messaging. The essence of consumer-driven contracts is that the ownership of the contract is inverted. Instead of the producer providing the definition, consumers define the contract they expect, and it's up to the producer to fulfill it.

In NServiceBus terminology, "producers" are called "publishers" and "consumers" are called "subscribers". Contracts translate to message contracts and are defined using plain C# types. To honor a consumer contract, the producer would make the relevant message contract inherit from the consumer contract type.

## Contracts as interfaces

CDC is the main reason that `interface` messages are supported in addition to classes. More than one consumer can provide a contract that would be satisfied by the same publisher message. This would not be possible if only classes were used because multiple inheritance isn't supported by C#. The solution is to use interfaces instead, which lets the publisher implement all relevant contract types on the same message type.

Assuming that the producers `MyEvent` would satisfy both `Consumer1Contract` and `Consumer2Contract`, it would look like this:

snippet: publisher-contracts

NOTE: One limitation of this approach is that two or more consumers can't require a property with the same name but different types because that wouldn't compile using C#.

## Running the sample

Run the sample and notice how each consumer receives its contract when the producer publishes `MyEvent`.

NOTE: Sharing contract types between endpoints is a larger topic, and this sample is using linked files for simplicity. See the [message contracts documentation](/nservicebus/messaging/evolving-contracts.md) for more details.
