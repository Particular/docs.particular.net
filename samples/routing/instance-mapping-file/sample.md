The sample demonstrates how to use a file to describe the mapping between logical endpoints and their physical instances (deployments of given logical endpoint to a concrete VM).


## Prerequisites

Make sure MSMQ is set up as described in the [MSMQ Transport - NServiceBus Configuration](/nservicebus/msmq/#nservicebus-configuration) section.


## Running the project

 1. Start the solution
 1. The text `Press <enter> to send a message` should be displayed in the Client's console window.
 1. Wait until all the endpoints exchange their routing information. Notice each endpoint logs the routing info as it discovers other endpoints.
 1. Hit `<enter>` several times to send some messages.


### Verifying that the sample works correctly

 1. The Sales.1 and Sales.2 consoles display information about accepted orders in round-robin fashion.
 1. The Shipping endpoint displays information that orders were shipped.
 1. The Billing endpoint displays information that orders were billed.


## Code walk-through

This sample contains four projects.


### Instance Mapping File

Shared between all endpoints.

snippet: instanceMapping


### Client

The Client application submits the orders for processing by the back-end systems by sending a `PlaceOrder` command. The client, as well as all other endpoints, uses the file based instance mapping:

snippet:FileInstanceMapping


### Sales

The Sales application accepts clients' orders and publishes the `OrderAccepted` event.

NOTE: In real-world scenarios NServiceBus endpoints are scaled out by deploying multiple physical instances of a single logical endpoint to multiple machines. For simplicity, in this sample the scale out is simulated by having two separate projects, Sales and Sales2.


### Shipping and Billing

Shipping and Billing applications subscribe to `OrderAccepted` event in order to execute their business logic.


### Shared project

The shared project contains definitions for messages.


## Real-world scenario

For the sake of simplicity, in this sample all the endpoints run on a single machine. In real world is is usually best to run each instance on a separate virtual machine. In such case the instance mapping file would contain `machine` attributes mapping instances to their machines' host names instead of `queue` attributes used to run more than one instance on a single box.
