DANGER: Asynchronous messaging is not an optimal solution for data distribution scenarios. It is usually better to use a dedicated data distribution technology for that purpose, such as a distributed cache or distributed configuration service. This sample aims to serve only as an example of the flexibility in the NServiceBus routing engine.

The sample demonstrates how NServiceBus [routing](/nservicebus/messaging/routing.md) can be used to implement data distribution scenarios. When using the built-in [Publish/Subscribe](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe) pattern in NServiceBus, event messages are delivered to a single instance of any subscribed endpoint. In this sample every event message is delivered to all instances of subscribed endpoints.


## Prerequisites

Make sure MSMQ is set up as described in the [MSMQ Transport - NServiceBus Configuration](/nservicebus/msmq/#nservicebus-configuration) section.


## Running the project

 1. Start all the projects by hitting F5.
 1. The text `Press <enter> to send a message` should be displayed in the Client.1 and Client.2 console windows.
 1. Press `<enter>` a couple of times in both Client windows.


### Verifying that the sample works correctly

 1. Notice that for each order message sent from any client there is a single confirmation `Order ABCD accepted` displayed in either Client.1 or Client.2 window. The `OrderAccepted` event is always processed by a single instance of the Client endpoint.
 1. Notice that for each order message there is `Invalidating cache` message displayed in both client consoles (data is being distributed to all instances).


## Code walk-through

This sample contains four projects.


### Client

The Client application submits the orders for processing by the back-end systems by sending a `PlaceOrder` command. Client also holds a local in-memory order cache that needs to be invalidated when an order is accepted by the back-end.

The client application consists of two endpoints. The main endpoint is used to send the `PlaceOrder` commands and process `OrderAccepted` events.

snippet:MainConfig

The auxiliary endpoint is used for data distribution purposes. It reacts on `OrderAccepted` events and invalidates the cache. In order to ensure each scaled out instance of Client receives its own copy of the event the logical name of the data distribution endpoint consists of the name of the main endpoint and a suffix which is specific to a given instance. Such suffix can be set in the configuration for each deployment or can be obtained from an environment (e.g. Azure role instance ID).

snippet:DistributionEndpointName

NServiceBus uses assembly scanning to load user-provided components such as message handlers. When co-hosting two endpoints in a single process it is important to make sure NServiceBus loads correct components to each endpoint. In this sample `DataDistribution` namespace is used to mark data distribution components

snippet:DistributionEndpointTypes

NOTE: In real-world scenarios NServiceBus endpoints are scaled out by deploying multiple physical instances of a single logical endpoint to multiple machines. For simplicity, in this sample the scale out is simulated by having two separate projects, Client and Client2.


### Server

The Server application processes the `PlaceOrder` commands and publishes `OrderAccepted` events.


### Shared project

The shared project contains definitions for messages.
