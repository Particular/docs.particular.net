Note how `Subscriber` immediately receives the messages that were published while it was not running. The publisher safely places the message into the transport in this case LearningTransport without knowledge of the running status of any subscriber. LearningTransport safely places the message in the inbound queue of the subscriber where it awaits handling. Even when processes or machines restart, NServiceBus protects messages from being lost.
