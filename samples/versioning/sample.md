This sample shows how to handle message schema evolution in a backward-compatible manner. The project consists of a publishing endpoint that has evolved from one version of the schema to the next. The newer subscriber has access to the additional information in the newest version of the scheam while the older keeps operating without interruptions.

In this sample there are two message projects: `V1.Messages` and `V2.Messages`:

snippet: V1Message

The Version 2 message schema inherits from the Version 1 schema as shown below, adding another property on top of the properties in the Version 1 schema.

snippet: V2Message

Each subscriber may use any of the versions, as the system is upgraded gradually.

Subscribers have a message handler for the messages from their respective versions. Yet there is a slight difference in their subscriptions configuration; `V1Subscriber` has:

While `V2Subscriber` has:

snippet: V2SubscriberMapping

The only difference is that each subscriber declares the version of the schema on which it dependents. In addition, the `V2Subscriber` also subscribes to the new version of the message.

`V2Publisher` is publishing a message from the Version 2 schema only. However, `V1Subscriber` receives these messages as well:


### Publisher output

```
Press 'Enter' to publish a message, Ctrl + C to exit.
Published event.
```

### V1Subscriber output

```
Press any key to stop program
Something happened with some data 1 and no more info
```

### V2Subscriber output

```
Press any key to stop program
Something happened with some data 1 and more information It's a secret.
```

## When receivers require additional data

In some cases, receivers might require additional data in order to process a message. However, it may occur that the endpoint receives a message of the previous contract.
In such a scenario, a saga might be used to retrieve the additional data and send a new message that matches the V2 contract.

The handler that accepts the V1 version of the contract, could look something like this:

snippet: ReceivingV1

The handler that accepts the V2 version of the contract, will contain the implementation that handles the fully populated message:
