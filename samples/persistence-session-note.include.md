> [!NOTE]
> The persister is able to reuse the connection and transaction managed by SQL Server transport, so the endpoints can run in the `TransportTransactionMode.SendsAtomicWithReceive` while ensuring exactly once message processing guarantees. This is true as long as persistence session APIs are used to access connection and transaction.
