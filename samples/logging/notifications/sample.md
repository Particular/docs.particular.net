## Introduction

This sample shows how to use the recoverability [error notifications](/nservicebus/recoverability/subscribing-to-error-notifications.md) to capture the following:

 * When a [Immediate Retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#immediate-retries) occurs.
 * When a [Delayed Retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#delayed-retries) occurs.
 * When a message fails all retries and is forwarded to the error queue.


## Custom Settings in this sample

This sample uses several non-standard settings.


### Logging

All errors below Fatal are suppressed to reduce the noise related to raising multiple exceptions
