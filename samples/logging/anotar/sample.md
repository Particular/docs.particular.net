This sample shows how to used the community run project [Anotar](https://github.com/Fody/Anotar) to simplify logging when integrating with NServiceBus.

Anotar simplifies logging through a static class and some IL manipulation done by [Fody](https://github.com/Fody). When using Anotar no static log field is necessary per class and extra information is captured for each log entry written.


## Including Anotar

When the Anotar NuGet package is pulled in Fody will create a configuration file (`FodyWeavers.xml`) with the following:

snippet: weavers

This tells the underlying Fody IL weaving engine to inject Anotar into the build pipeline.


## Using Anotar LogTo

To use Anotar write a log entry via any of the static methods. For example in a handler:

snippet: handler

This will result in the following being compiled

snippet: resulthandler
