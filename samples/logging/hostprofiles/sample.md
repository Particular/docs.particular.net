## Code walk-through

Illustrates how to configure logging using the [profiles](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/profiles.md) functionality of the NServiceBus host.


### Change the default profile

The startup action for this sample is configured to use the Lite profile in the `.csproj`.

### Logging helper

This is a simple helper that takes in a threshold as a parameter and configures logging based on that parameter.

### Profile Handlers

Inside the `LoggingHandlers` directory there are `IConfigureLoggingForProfile`s handlers for each of the profiles. Note that they all implement `IConfigureLoggingForProfile<T>`.
