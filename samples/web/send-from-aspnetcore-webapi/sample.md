This sample shows how to send messages to a NServiceBus endpoint from a ASP.NET Core WebAPI application. **It only works for ASP.NET Core solutions targeting the full .NET Framework. The .NET Core runtime is currently not supported.**

Run the solution, a new browser window/tab opens, as well as a console application.

The browser will open up the URL `http://localhost:51863/api/sendmessage`. An async [WebAPI](https://www.asp.net/web-api) controller handles the request. It creates an NServiceBus message and sends it to the endpoint running in the console application. The message has been processed successfully when the console application prints "Message received at endpoint". 


### Prerequisites

- Install [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows)


### Initialize the WebAPI endpoint

Open `Startup.cs` and look at the `ConfigureServices` method.

A [Send-Only endpoint](/nservicebus/hosting/#self-hosting-send-only-hosting) named `Samples.ASPNETCore.Sender` is configured in the WebAPI application by creating a new `EndpointConfiguration`.

Routing is configured to send every message from the assembly containing `MyMessage` to the `Samples.ASPNETCore.Endpoint` endpoint.

The endpoint is started. At this point, the configuration is locked.

Finally, the endpoint is registered as a singleton instance of type `IMessageSession` in ASP.NET Cores `ServiceCollection`, ready to be injected into the controller.

An alternative would be to register the instance as type `IEndpointInstance`. `IMessageSession` is a leaner interface, containing only the methods necessary to send/publish messages. It is a good choice for [sending messages outside message handlers](/nservicebus/upgrades/5to6/moving-away-from-ibus.md#migrating-away-from-ibus-sending-messages-outside-message-handlers) if no endpoint management functionality is required.

### Injection into the Controller

The endpoint instance is injected into the `SendMessageController` at construction time by ASP.NET Core.

### Sending the message 

Send and await messages through the `IMessageSession` instance provided by ASP.NET Core.

### Processing the message 

The message is picked up and processed by a message handler in the `Samples.ASPNETCore.Endpoint` endpoint.
