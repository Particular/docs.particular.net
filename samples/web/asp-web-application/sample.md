This sample shows how to send messages from an ASP.NET Core web application to an NServiceBus endpoint.

## Run the sample

When running the solution a new browser window/tab opens, as well as a console application.

Enter the number "1" into the text box in the browser and click "Go". Notice the result "None" appears, as shown:

Changing the number in the text box from even to odd numbers changes the result in the Server console.

The web page renders synchronously; from the user's perspective, the interaction is synchronous and blocking, even though behind the scenes NServiceBus is implementing an asynchronous send-reply pattern using the [callbacks package](/nservicebus/messaging/callbacks.md).

## Configuration

This sample has three projects: `Shared`, `Server`, and `WebApp`. `WebApp` is an ASP.NET Core web application that sends messages (found in the `Shared` project) to the `Server` project, which is hosted as a console application.

### Initializing NServiceBus

In `WebApp`, open `Program.cs` and look at the code in the `UseNServiceBus` method:

snippet: ApplicationStart

### Sending a message

Open `Index.cshtml.cs` in `WebApp` to see the `OnPostAsync` method:

snippet: ActionHandling

The first line of code parses the text passed in by the user. The second line creates a new NServiceBus message of the type `Command`, and initializes its `Id` property with the value from the text box.

Open the class definition for the `Command` type in the `Shared` project:

snippet: Message

Return to `Index.cshtml.cs` and look at the code `messageSession.Request`. The message session offers methods to send messages via NServiceBus. Skip the rest of the code and see what happens to the message just sent.

### Handling the message

In the `Server` project, find this code in the `CommandMessageHandler` class:

snippet: Handler

This class implements the NServiceBus interface `IHandleMessages<T>` where `T` is the specific message type being handled; in this case, the `Command` message. NServiceBus manages classes that implement this interface. When a message arrives in the input queue, it is deserialized and then, based on its type, NServiceBus instantiates the relevant message handler classes and calls their `Handle` method, passing in the message object.

In the method body notice the response being returned to the originating endpoint. This will result in a message being added to the input queue for `MyWebClient` endpoint.


## Handling the response

When the response arrives back at `WebApp`, NServiceBus invokes the callback that was registered when the request was sent.

The `messageSession.Request` method takes the callback code and tells NServiceBus to invoke it when the response is received. There are several overloads of this method; the code above accepts a generic `Enum` parameter, effectively casting the return code from the server to the given enumeration type.

Finally, the code updates the `Text` property of a label on the web page, setting it to the string that represents the enumeration value: sometimes `None`, sometimes `Fail`.
