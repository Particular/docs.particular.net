This sample leverages the [SQL Server - HTTP Passthrough](/transports/sql/sql-http-passthrough.md) to provide a bridge between an HTTP stream (via JavaScript on a web page) and the [SQL Server Transport](/transports/sql/).

The flow of this sample is:

 * User performs an action on a web page that triggers JavaScript.
 * JavaScript posts the message body to a specific URL.
 * Controller takes the HTTP request and places it in a queue.
 * An endpoint receives the message and logs all contextual information.


## Prerequisites

include: sql-prereq

The database created by this sample is `SqlHttpPassthroughSample`.


## Running the sample

When the solution is started two projects will start:

 * Endpoint
 * Web (as a console and browser)

In the browser, press the button and a message will be received by the endpoint.


## Code walk-through


### SampleEndpoint

This is a standard NServiceBus endpoint that will receive the message.


#### EndpointConfiguration

The endpoint is configured as follows:

 * Use the [SQL Server transport](/transports/sql).
 * Use the [Newtonsoft JSON serializer](/nservicebus/serialization/newtonsoft.md). The choice of serializer is important since that format will need to be consistent when sending in the web context.
 * Use [SQL Attachments](/nservicebus/messaging/attachments-sql.md) for processing the binaries sent through HTTP.

#### Handler

The receiving handler outputs all incoming headers and attachments.

#### Message contract

There is a single message with a property to illustrate the data being passed through:

snippet: MessageContract

Note that the messages exist only in this endpoint and do not need to be used, via a reference, in the Web project.


### SampleWeb


#### Startup

At [ASP.NET Core Startup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/startup) several actions are taken:

 * `AddSqlHttpPassthrough` is called on [IServiceCollection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.iservicecollection) which makes the `ISqlPassthrough` interface available via [dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection).
 * `AddSqlHttpPassthroughBadRequestMiddleware` is called on [IApplicationBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.iapplicationbuilder), which adds [Middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/) to the pipeline. This means that if the request parsing code of the SQL HTTP Passthrough throws a `BadRequestException`, that exception can be gracefully handled and an [HTTP BadRequest (400)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400) can be sent as a response. This is optional, and a controller can choose to explicitly catch and handle `BadRequestException` in a different way.

#### PassthroughController

The `PassthroughController` consists of several parts.

 * `ISqlPassthrough` injected through [dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection).
 * The controller handling the HTTP Post and passing that information to `ISqlPassthrough.Send`.

WARNING: In a production application, the controller would perform authorization and authentication on the incoming request.


#### SampleClientController

The `SampleClientController` serves up the HTML UI for this sample.

snippet: SampleClientController


#### HTML form

The HTML captures the data that will be submitted to the `PassthroughController`.

snippet: form


#### Form submission

The JavaScript that submits the data does so through by building up a [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object and [POSTing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data#The_POST_method) that via the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

snippet: PostToBus


#### MessageId generation

For deduplication to operate, the client must generate a [MessageId](/nservicebus/messaging/message-identity.md), so that any retries can be ignored. JavaScript does not contain native functionality to generate a GUID, so a helper method is used.

snippet: Guid


## Testing

The solution includes an integration test that verifies that a submitted HTTP request is intercepted by the SampleEndpoint.
