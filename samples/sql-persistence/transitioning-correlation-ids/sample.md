This sample illustrates an approach for transitioning between different [correlation IDs](/persistence/sql/saga.md#correlation-ids) in a way that requires no endpoint downtime or migration of saga data stored in sql.

> [!NOTE]
> The sample uses three "Phase" endpoint projects to illustrate the iterations of a single endpoint in one solution.

include: sqlpersistence-prereqs

## Scenario

The sample uses a hypothetical "Order" scenario where the requirement is to transition from an an integer correlation ID `OrderNumber` to a GUID correlation ID `OrderId`.

To move between phases, after running each phase adjust the startup project list in solution properties. E.g. after phase 1, disable endpoints that contain "Phase1" in the name, and enable endpoints that contain "Phase2".

## Phases

### Phase 1

In the initial phase, an integer `OrderNumber` is used for the correlation ID. In the `ConfigureHowToFindSaga` method, the saga maps `StartOrder.OrderNumber` from the incoming message to `OrderSagaData.OrderNumber` in the saga data.

### Phase 2

In the second phase a GUID `OrderId` is added. The saga still maps `StartOrder.OrderNumber` to `OrderSagaData.OrderNumber` in the `ConfigureHowToFindSaga` method. However it also introduces a correlation to `OrderSagaData.OrderId` via a `transitionalCorrelationProperty` in the `[SqlSaga]` attribute.

> [!WARNING]
> Prior to moving to Phase 3 it is necessary to verify that all existing sagas have the `Correlation_OrderId` column populated. This can either be inferred by the business knowledge (i.e. certain saga may have a known and constrained lifetime) or by querying the database.

### Phase 3

In the third phase, the integer `OrderNumber` is removed leaving only the `OrderId`. The saga now maps `StartOrder.OrderId` to `OrderSagaData.OrderId` in the `ConfigureHowToFindSaga` method.
