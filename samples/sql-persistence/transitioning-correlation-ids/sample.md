This sample illustrates an approach for transitioning between different [Correlation Ids](/nservicebus/sql-persistence/saga.md#correlation-ids) in way that requires no endpoint downtime and no migration of saga data stored in sql.

NOTE: This sample uses 3 "Phase" Endpoint Projects to illustrate the iterations of a single endpoint in one solution.


## Prerequisites

partial: prereqs


## Scenario

This samples uses a hypothetical "Order" scenario where the requirement is to transition from an an int correlation id `OrderNumber` to a guid correlation id `OrderId`. 


## Phases


### Phase 1

In the initial phase an int `OrderNumber` is used. The saga maps to `StartOrder.OrderNumber` in the `ConfigureMapping` and correlates to `OrderSagaData.OrderNumber` via a `SqlSagaAttribute` with `correlationProperty` of `OrderNumber`.

### Phase 2

In the second phase a guid `OrderId` is added. The saga still maps to `StartOrder.OrderNumber` in the `ConfigureMapping` and correlates on to `OrderSagaData.OrderNumber`. However it also correlates to `OrderSagaData.OrderId` via a `transitionalCorrelationProperty`.

WARNING: Prior to moving to Phase 3 it is necessary to verify that all existing sagas have the `Correlation_OrderId` column populated. This can either be inferred by the business knowledge (i.e. certain saga may have a know and constrained lifetime) or by querying the database.


### Phase 3

In the third phase the int `OrderNumber` is removed leaving only the `OrderId`. The saga now maps to `StartOrder.OrderId` in the `ConfigureMapping` and correlates to `OrderSagaData.OrderId` via a `SqlSagaAttribute` with `correlationProperty` of `OrderNumber`.
