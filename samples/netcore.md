title: Samples supporting .NET Core
summary: Samples containing a .NET Core solution
reviewed: 2022-11-09
---

The following samples contain variants for both .NET Core and .NET Framework.

Both solutions are contained within the same zip file, and use the same underlying C# files, but with separate `.sln` and `.csproj` files.

For example, the [Full Duplex sample](/samples/fullduplex/) download will contain:

* **FullDuplex.sln** - Solution for .NET Framework
* **FullDuplex.Core.sln** - Solution for .NET Core
* **Server** - Project directory
    * **Server.csproj** - Project for .NET Framework
    * **Server.Core.csproj** - Project for .NET Core

NOTE: Be sure to review the [general information about running samples](/samples/).
