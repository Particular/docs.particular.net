This sample demonstrates how to append the current username to outgoing messages and then how to extract that value when messages are handled.


### Fake principal

For demonstration purposes, prior to sending a message, the `Thread.CurrentPrincipal` will be replaced with a new instance. In a production scenario, the `Thread.CurrentPrincipal` would be either the impersonated user from IIS or the current user sending a message.

## Custom header with a mutator

The recommended approach for capturing the current user is to create a transport mutator that extracts the current identity and then adds it to the header of every outgoing message.


### Outgoing mutator

The outgoing mutator extracts `Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name` and appends it to a message header.

#### Register the Mutator

### The Handler

From within a handler, the `Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name` will have the value that was specified in the Outgoing Mutator:
