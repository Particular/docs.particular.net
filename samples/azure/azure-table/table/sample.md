This sample shows a client/server scenario using a dynamic table configuration for certain saga types with a fallback to the default table.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that an instance of the latest [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator) or [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) is running.

## Projects

### SharedMessages

The shared message contracts used by all endpoints.

### Client

* Sends the `StartOrder` message to `Server`.
* Receives and handles the `OrderCompleted` event.

### Server projects

* Receive the `StartOrder` message and initiate an `OrderSaga`.
* `OrderSaga` sends a `ShipOrder` command to `ShipOrderSaga`
* `ShipOrderSaga` requests a timeout with an instance of `CompleteOrder` with the saga data.
* `ShipOrderSaga` replies with `CompleteOrder` when the `CompleteOrder` timeout fires.
* `OrderSaga` publishes an `OrderCompleted` event when the `CompleteOrder` message arrives.

### Persistence config

Configure the endpoint to use Azure Table Persistence.

In the non-transactional mode the saga id is used as a partition.

## Behaviors

For all messages destined to go to the `ShipOrderSaga` the table is overridden at runtime to use `ShipOrderSagaData` table.

The behavior needs to be registered in the pipeline
