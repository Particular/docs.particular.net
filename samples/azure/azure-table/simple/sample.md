## Prerequisites

Ensure that an instance of the latest [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator) or [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) is running.

## Projects

### SharedMessages

The shared message contracts used by all endpoints.

### Client

* Sends the `StartOrder` message to `Server`.
* Receives and handles the `OrderCompleted` event.

### Server projects

* Receive the `StartOrder` message and initiate an `OrderSaga`.
* `OrderSaga` requests a timeout with an instance of `CompleteOrder` with the saga data.
* `OrderSaga` publishes an `OrderCompleted` event when the `CompleteOrder` timeout fires.

### Persistence config

Configure the endpoint to use Azure Table Persistence.

In the non-transactional mode the saga id is used as a partition key.
