## Prerequisites

include: asb-connectionstring 

Environment variables named `AzureServiceBus.ConnectionString1` and `AzureServiceBus.ConnectionString2`, each having a different connection string to an Azure Service Bus namespace.

include: asb-transport


## Code walk-through

There are three endpoints in this sample:

* `Sender`
* `Receiver`
* `SenderReceiver`


### Sender

`Sender` sends `SomeMessage` to `Receiver`.

snippet: SomeMessage

The sender sends a large number of messages to the receiver and measures how long it takes. The total time is divided by the number of messages sent in order to compute the average throughput. 

There are two variations of the `Sender` which present different ways of sending messages and illustrate what impact they have on performance.


### Receiver

`Receiver` receives `SomeMessage` and computes how many it was able to receive every second. Again there are various permutations of settings that impact the receive throughput.


### SenderReceiver

`SenderReceiver` is a variation of the `Receiver` that does not only receive messages, but it also sends messages to a destination queue.


## Running the sample

Run without debugging (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>) for optimal results.

 * Run the `Sender` standalone to test the send performance, but also to fill up the receive queue.
 * Run the `Receiver` standalone to test the receive performance. If the queue empties, run the sender again.
 * Run the `SenderReceiver` standalone.
 

## Variations
 

### Slow (sequential) sender

In the slow sender scenario:
 * Only one factory is defined, this means that only one TCP connection is maintained with the broker.
 * Client-side batching of the ASB SDK is turned off, so the SDK will send only one message at a time.

Snippet: slow-send-config

In this scenario, each send is awaited individually, which prevents batching (even if batching is enabled on the client).

Snippet: slow-send  


### Fast (concurrent) sender

In the fast sender scenario:
 * Multiple connections are established by configuring multiple messaging factories.
 * Each factory is matched with a sender object (there should be one sender per factory).
 * Client-side batching is on, allowing the ASB SDK to send many messages at once.

Snippet: fast-send-config

Individual sends are not awaited, instead the entire batch is awaited. Code execution will continue when all batches are sent.

Snippet: fast-send


### Slow (sequential) atomic receiver

In the slow atomic receiver scenario:
 * Only one factory is defined, this means that only one TCP connection is maintained with the broker.
 * Prefetching is turned off, meaning that the receiver will fetch only one message at a time.
 * No concurrent operations are allowed; messages are processed one by one.

Snippet: slow-atomic-receiver-config


### Fast (concurrent) atomic receiver

In the fast atomic receiver scenario:
 * Multiple connections are established with the broker.
 * Each connection is matched with exactly one receive client.
 * Ensures that at least 16 connections are established when using partitioned queues, as each partitioned queue consists of 16 partitions. Depending on the available bandwidth, more can be added until the network saturates.
 * Transaction mode `AtomicSendsWithReceive` will execute complete operations in a serializable transaction, which means one by one. Therefore it is not beneficial to allow high concurrency per receiver. A value of 2 allows one receive to start while another is completed. The more time execution takes, the higher this value can be, but in that scenario one should never use very high values.
 * PrefetchCount is set to a relatively low number, since receiver concurrency and throughput are also low.

Snippet: fast-atomic-receiver-config


### Fast (concurrent) atomic sender receiver

The fast atomic sender receiver scenario is similar to the fast atomic receiver scenario, except that it establishes twice the number of connections so that the receive clients and send clients can leverage different connections.

Snippet: fast-atomic-send-receive-config


### Slow (sequential) non-atomic receiver

In the sequential non-atomic receiver scenario:
 * Only one factory is defined, this means that only one TCP connection is maintained with the broker.
 * Prefetching is turned off, meaning that the receiver will fetch only one message at a time.
 * No concurrent operations are allowed; messages are processed one by one.

Snippet: slow-non-atomic-receiver-config


### Fast (concurrent) non-atomic receiver

In the fast non-atomic receiver scenario:
 * Multiple connections are established with the broker.
 * Each connection is matched with exactly one receive client.
 * Ensures that at least 16 connections are established when using partitioned queues, as each partitioned queue consists of 16 partitions. Depending on available bandwidth configure, more can be added until the network saturates.
 * TransactionMode `ReceiveOnly` can batch message completions, allowing receive operations to work independently. Therefore it is beneficial to allow high concurrency per receiver. For example, 128 operations per receiver if the operation can handle this kind of concurrency. The effect that concurrency level will have on the application depends on the code inside the handler, e.g. a database connection, may not support 128 concurrent operations, while an in-memory operation on a concurrent data structure will benefit from it.
 * PrefetchCount is set to a high number as well, usually 1x or 2x the allowed per-receiver concurrency.

### Fast (concurrent) non-atomic sender receiver

The fast non-atomic sender receiver scenario is similar to the fast non-atomic receiver scenario except that it establishes twice the number of connections, so that the receive clients and send clients can leverage different connections.
