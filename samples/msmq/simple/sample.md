## Prerequisites

Ensure that MSMQ has been installed.


## Code walk-through

This sample shows basic usage of MSMQ as a transport for NServiceBus. The application sends an empty message to itself, via the MSMQ transport, and writes to the console when the message is received.


### Configuration

snippet: ConfigureMsmqEndpoint

Other settings such as DeadLetterQueue, Journal behavior, etc., can also be configured via the [connection string](/transports/msmq/connection-strings.md).
