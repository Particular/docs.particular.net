This sample shows basic usage of MSMQ as storage for subscriptions.


## Prerequisites

Ensure that MSMQ has been installed.


## Code walk-through

The application publishes an empty event to itself and writes to the console when the event is received. 


### Configuration

snippet: ConfigureMsmqPersistenceEndpoint


NOTE: MSMQ Persistence only supports subscription storage so another storage is needed for Timeouts since MSMQ doesn't have native timeout support.
