This sample shows a basic saga using AWS Lambda with SQS and Aurora.

## Prerequisites

The sample includes a [`CloudFormation`](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/) template, which will deploy the Lambda function and create the necessary queues to run the code.

The [`Amazon.Lambda.Tools` CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet) can be used to deploy the template to an AWS account.

1. Install the [`Amazon.Lambda.Tools CLI`](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet#amazonlambdatools) using `dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools`
1. Create an S3 bucket in the AWS region of choice
1. Create a publicly accessible Aurora MySql database (see [AWS documentation](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/aurora-mysql-connect-outside-vpc) for more information)
1. Update the connection string in the `DeployDatabase` project and run it to deploy the database schema

INFO: A publicly accessible Aurora cluster is only required for the purpose of running this sample but this is not required for the production code. Make sure to configure appropiate limited access to the database cluster.

## Running the sample

INFO: It is not possible at this stage to use the AWS .NET Mock Lambda Test Tool to run the sample locally.

Open the file `serverless.template` in the `Sales` project and update the value of the environment variable `AuroraLambda_ConnectionString` with the database's connection string.

Run the following command from the `Sales` directory to deploy the Lambda project:

`dotnet lambda deploy-serverless`

The deployment will ask for a stack name and an S3 bucket name to deploy the serverless stack. After that, running the sample will launch a single console window:

* **ClientUI** is a console application that will send a `PlaceOrder` command to the `Samples.Aurora.Lambda.Sales` endpoint, which is monitored by the AWS Lambda.
* The deployed **Sales** project will receive messages from the `Samples.Aurora.Lambda.Sales` queue and process them using the AWS Lambda runtime.

To try the AWS Lambda:

1. From the **ClientUI** window, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to send a `PlaceOrder` message to the trigger queue.
2. The AWS Lambda will receive the `PlaceOrder` message and will start the `OrderSaga`.
3. The `OrderSaga` will publish an `OrderReceived` event and a business SLA message `OrderDelayed`.
4. The AWS Lambda receives the `OrderReceived` event which is handled by the `BillCustomerHandler` and the `StageInventoryHandler`. After a delay, each handler publishes an event, `CustomerBilled` and `InventoryStaged`, respectively.
5. The AWS Lambda will receive the events. Once both events are received, the `OrderSaga` publishes an `OrderShipped` event. In case it took longer than the defined business SLA to bill and stage the order the client is informed about the order being delayed by publishing `OrderDelayed`.
6. The **ClientUI** will handle the `OrderShipped` event and log a message to the console. It might occasionally also handle the `OrderDelayed` event and handout 10% coupon codes.

## Code walk-through

The **ClientUI** console application is an Amazon SQS endpoint that sends `PlaceOrder` commands and handles the `OrderShipped` event.

The **Sales** project is hosted using AWS Lambda. The static NServiceBus endpoint must be configured using details that come from the AWS Lambda `ILambdaContext`. Since that is not available until a message is handled by the function, the NServiceBus endpoint instance is deferred until the first message is processed, using a lambda expression such as:

snippet: EndpointSetup

The same class defines the AWS Lambda, which hosts the NServiceBus endpoint. The `ProcessOrder` method hands off processing of the message to NServiceBus:

snippet: FunctionHandler

Meanwhile, the `OrderSaga` hosted within the AWS Lambda project, is a regular NServiceBus saga which is also capable of sending messages receiving messages itself.

snippet: OrderSaga

## Removing the sample stack

Remove the deployed stack with the following command:

`dotnet lambda delete-serverless`

and provide the previously chosen stack name.
