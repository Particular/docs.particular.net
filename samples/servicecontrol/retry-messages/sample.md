title: Retry failed messages using ServicePulse
summary: A sample showing how to retry failed messages
component: Core

This sample shows how to retry a failed message. The sample uses the [Learning Transport](/transports/learning/) and a portable version of the Particular Service Platform tools. Installing ServiceControl is **not** required.

## Running the solution

Running the solution starts 3 console windows. Wait a moment until the ServicePulse window opens in the browser.

### Sender

The sender is a program that uses NServiceBus to send simple test messages.

```cmd
2024-09-12 09:38:38.902 INFO  Logging to 'C:\Particular\docs.particular.net\samples\servicecontrol\retry-messages\Core_9\Sender\bin\Debug\net8.0\' with level Info
2024-09-12 09:38:39.070 INFO  Selected active license from C:\ProgramData\ParticularSoftware\license.xml
License Expiration: 2029-10-31
Press 'Enter' to send a new message. Press any other key to finish.
```

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the Sender console window to send one.

### Receiver

The receiver reads messages off a queue and processes them. By default, it runs in a fault simulation mode, which causes message processing to fail, including the one that has just been sent.

```cmd
2024-09-12 09:38:38.826 INFO  Logging to 'C:\Particular\docs.particular.net\samples\servicecontrol\retry-messages\Core_9\Receiver\bin\Debug\net8.0\' with level Info

Press 't' to toggle fault mode or `Esc` to stop.

Press <kbd>t</kbd> to disable the fault simulation mode so that the message is processed correctly once retried.

### ServicePulse

Going back to the ServicePulse browser window, there is a notification on the dashboard about one failed message. 

![service-pulse-dash-error](service-pulse-dash-error.png)

Click on the failure symbol to see the datails. You can inspect the message headers as well as the payload.

![service-pulse-error-details](service-pulse-error-details.png)

Now click `Request retry` to initiate the message retry process i.e. sending the message back to the receiver's input queue for reprocessing.

![service-pulse-retry-in-progress](service-pulse-retry-in-progress.png)

Once the process is completed, go back to the Receiver console window.

### Receiver

You can now notice that the message has been successfully processed.

```cmd

## Code walk-through

For simplicity, both [the immediate](/nservicebus/recoverability#immediate-retries) and [the delayed retries](/nservicebus/recoverability/#delayed-retries) are disabled in the sample. As a result, messages are moved to the error queue after a single failed processing attempt:

snippet: DisableRetries

The receiver's failure mode is controlled by the `FaultMode` property. When `true` processing of `SimpleMessage` messages ends with an exception.
