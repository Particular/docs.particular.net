External, third-party systems becoming unavailable might cause message-processing failures. The Particular Platform supports monitoring of third-party systems exposed as HTTP endpoints. This sample shows how to set up such monitoring using custom checks.

## The custom check

The monitoring logic implements a `PeriodicCheck` which calls a configured URI whenever the specified interval elapses. When the third-party system doesn't respond in a timely fashion, a `CheckResult.Failed` event is sent to ServiceControl.
