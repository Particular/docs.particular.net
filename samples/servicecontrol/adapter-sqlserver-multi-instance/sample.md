This sample shows how to configure ServiceControl to monitor endpoints and retry messages when using SQL Server transport in a multi-database mode.

The purpose of the adapter is to isolate ServiceControl from the specifics of the physical deployment topology of the business endpoints (such as [SQL Server multi-instance](/transports/sql/deployment-options.md?version=SqlTransport_3#multi-instance.md) mode). 


## Prerequisistes

 1. [Install ServiceControl](/servicecontrol/installation.md).
 2. Create `ServiceControl` database on the local SQL Server instance. 
 3. Using [ServiceControl Management](/servicecontrol/license.md#servicecontrol-management-app) tool, set up ServiceControl to monitor endpoints using SQL Server transport:
	 
   * Add a new ServiceControl instance: 
   * Use `Particular.ServiceControl.SQL` as the instance name (ensure there is no other instance of SC running with the same name).
   * Use "User" account and provide credentials to allow for integrated authentication.
   * Specify `Data Source=.\SqlExpress;Initial Catalog=ServiceControl;Integrated Security=True;Max Pool Size=100;Min Pool Size=10` as a connection string. ServiceControl Manager will automatically create queue tables in the database.

NOTE: If other ServiceControl instances have been running on this machine, it's necessary to specify a non-default port number for API. [Adjust ServicePulse settings](/servicepulse/host-config.md#changing-the-servicecontrol-url) accordingly to point to this location.
 
 4. Ensure the `ServiceControl` process is running before running the sample.  
 5. [Install ServicePulse](/servicepulse/installation.md)

NOTE: In order to connect to a different SQL Server instance, ensure all database connection strings are updated in the sample.

## Code walk-through 

The following diagram shows the topology of the solution:

![Topology diagram](diagram.svg)

The code base consists of four projects.

### Shared

The Shared project contains the message contracts and the physical topology definition. The topology is defined in the `Connections` class via a method that takes the name of the queue table ([physical address](/transports/sql/addressing.md)) and returns the connection string to be used to access that queue.

snippet: GetConnectionString

The `StartsWith` comparison ensures that the [satellite](/nservicebus/satellites/) queues are correctly addressed. The [poison queue](/servicecontrol/transport-adapter/#queue-configuration-poison-message-queue) is used by the adapter for unrecoverable failures. 

This topology is used in business endpoints (Sales, Shipping) as well as in the Adapter.


### Sales and Shipping

The Sales and Shipping projects contain endpoints that simulate the execution of a business process. The process consists of two events: `OrderAccepted` published by Sales and subscribed by Shipping and `OrderShipped` published by Shipping and subscribed by Sales.

The Sales and Shipping endpoints use separate databases and their transports are configured in the [multi-instance](/transports/sql/deployment-options.md?version=SqlTransport_3#multi-instance.md) mode using the topology definition from the `Connections` class.

The business endpoints include a message processing failure simulation mode (toggled by pressing `f`) which can be used to generate failed messages for demonstrating message retry functionality.

The Shipping endpoint has the Heartbeats plugin installed to enable uptime monitoring via ServicePulse.


### Adapter

The Adapter project hosts the `ServiceControl.TransportAdapter`. The adapter has two sides: endpoint-facing and ServiceControl-facing. In this sample both use SQL Server transport:

snippet: AdapterTransport

The following code configures the adapter to use [multi-instance](/transports/sql/deployment-options.md?version=SqlTransport_3#multi-instance.md) mode of SQL Server transport when communicating with the business endpoints.

snippet: EndpointSideConfig

While the following code configures the adapter to communicate with ServiceControl:

snippet: SCSideConfig

Because the ServiceControl has been installed under a non-default instance name (`Particular.ServiceControl.SQL`) the control queue name needs to be overridden in the adapter configuration:

snippet: ControlQueueOverride
