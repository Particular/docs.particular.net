## Code walk-through

This sample shows how to host an in-process instance of NServiceBus.

snippet: self-hosting

WARNING: Although not shown in this sample, when self-hosting NServiceBus, the [critical error action](/nservicebus/hosting/critical-errors.md) should always be overridden. If a critical error occurs, NServiceBus will stop the endpoint but will not shut down the process. By specifying a critical error action, the host application can elect to terminate in order to be respawned, or take action to notify system administrators of the failure.
