This sample demonstrates how to use Docker Linux containers to host NServiceBus endpoints communicating over the [RabbitMQ transport](/transports/rabbitmq/).

## Prerequisites

This sample requires that the following tools are installed:

 * [.NET Core 2.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
 * [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) or higher
 * If using Windows, [configure Docker to use Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers) to support the Linux-based RabbitMQ container


## Running the sample

Running the sample involves building the code, preparing it for deployment, building container images and finally starting the multi-container application.


### Building and publishing binaries

The first step is to build the binaries using the .NET Core command line tools:

```bash
$ dotnet build
```

The compiled binaries need to be prepared for deployment into the container:

```bash
$ dotnet publish
```


### Building container images

The prepared binaries and container image definitions (Dockerfiles) are enough to build container images for both the `Sender` and the `Receiver`:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```


### Starting containers

When the container images are ready, the containers can be started:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```


## Observing containers

Both containers log to the console. These logs can be inspected:

```bash
$ docker-compose logs sender
$ docker-compose logs receiver
```


### Stopping and removing containers

The containers can be stopped and removed:

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

## Code walk-through

This sample consists of `Sender` and `Publisher` endpoints exchanging messages using the [RabbitMQ transport](/transports/rabbitmq/). Each of these three components runs in a separate Docker Linux container.


### Endpoint Docker image

Each endpoint is a container built on top of the official `microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime` image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). The container image is built using endpoint binaries from the `bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/publish` folder:

```dockerfile
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime
WORKDIR /Receiver
COPY ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Receiver.dll"]
```

NOTE: Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet publish` commands to generate endpoint binaries before creating the image.


### Multi-container application

Endpoint container images for the `Sender` and the `Receiver` are combined with an official [RabbitMQ image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) to create a multi-container application using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```yaml
version: "3"
services:   
    sender:
        image: sender
        build:
            context: ./Sender/
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        depends_on:
            - rabbitmq
    receiver:
        image: receiver
        build:
            context: ./Receiver/
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        depends_on:
            - rabbitmq
    rabbitmq:
        image: "rabbitmq:3-management"
        ports:
            - "15672:15672"
```


### Transport configuration

Endpoints configure the RabbitMQ transport to use the broker instance running in the `rabbitmq` container:

snippet: TransportConfiguration


### Waiting for RabbitMQ broker to become available

Docker Compose manages the dependencies between the containers and starts the `rabbitmq` container first but there is still a delay between when the RabbitMQ container starts and when the broker starts to accept client connections. Endpoints must wait for the broker to become available before starting the endpoint:

snippet: WaitForRabbitBeforeStart

snippet: WaitForRabbit
