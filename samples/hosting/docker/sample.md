This sample demonstrates how to use Docker Linux containers to host NServiceBus endpoints communicating over the [RabbitMQ transport](/transports/rabbitmq/).

## Prerequisites

This sample requires that the following tools are installed:

 * [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
 * [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) or higher
 * If using Windows, [configure Docker to use Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers) to support the Linux-based RabbitMQ container

## Running the sample

Running the sample involves building the container images and starting the multi-container application.

### Building container images

Building the container images using the following command will `dotnet publish` (which includes `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build`) the endpoints in addition to building the container images for both the `Sender` and the `Receiver`:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

### Starting containers

When the container images are ready, the containers can be started:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Observing containers

Both containers log to the console. These logs can be inspected:

```bash
$ docker-compose logs sender
$ docker-compose logs receiver
```

### Stopping and removing containers

The containers can be stopped and removed:

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

## Code walk-through

This sample consists of `Sender` and `Receiver` endpoints exchanging messages using the [RabbitMQ transport](/transports/rabbitmq/). Each of these three components runs in a separate Docker Linux container.

### Endpoint Docker image

Each endpoint is a container built on top of the official `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.1` image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). The container image builds and publishes the endpoint binaries and then uses those artifacts to build the final container image:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:2.1 AS base

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.1 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
WORKDIR /src/Receiver
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Receiver.dll"]
```


### Multi-container application

Endpoint container images for the `Sender` and the `Receiver` are combined with an official [RabbitMQ image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) to create a multi-container application using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```yaml
version: "2.3"
services:   
    sender:
        image: sender
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: ./Sender/Dockerfile
        networks:
            - new
        depends_on:
            rabbitmq:
                condition: service_healthy
    receiver:
        image: receiver
        build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: ./Receiver/Dockerfile
        networks:
            - new
        depends_on:
            rabbitmq:
                condition: service_healthy
    rabbitmq:
        image: "rabbitmq:3.8-management"
        ports:
            - "15672:15672"
        networks:
            - new
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD-SHELL", "if rabbitmqctl status; then \nexit 0 \nfi \nexit 1"]
            interval: 10s
            retries: 5
networks:
    new:
```

### Transport configuration

Endpoints configure the RabbitMQ transport to use the broker instance running in the `rabbitmq` container:

snippet: TransportConfiguration

### Waiting for RabbitMQ broker to become available

This sample takes advantage of Docker [healthchecks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) to ensure RabbitMQ is available before starting the endpoints.
