## Code walk-through

This sample shows how to host multiple Endpoints in one process. At start up the application creates two Endpoint Instances, connected to different queues using different configurations:

One important thing to keep in mind is that internally an [Inversion of Control](/nservicebus/containers/) container is utilized to register all its components as well as user-implemented handlers, sagas and components; the container is automatically configured at start up scanning all the assemblies found in the directory where the program is executed from, in order to enforce that each bus instance registers only its own components it is important to specify an assembly scan policy using [one of the supported approaches](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md):

NOTE: This is possible only when self-hosting and not using NServiceBus.Host
