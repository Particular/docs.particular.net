## Introduction

This sample leverages the pipeline provided unit of work management for message handlers. Using the pipeline instead of the [`IManageUnitsOfWork`](/nservicebus/pipeline/unit-of-work.md#implementing-custom-unit-of-work-imanageunitsofwork) abstraction is necessary when access to the incoming message and/or headers is required.


## Code Walk Through


### Creating the Behavior

The behavior will wrap handler invocations and:

 1. Open a session to the database.
 1. Make the session available to the message handlers.
 1. Commit/Rollback the session depending on the outcome of the handler.
 1. Dispose the session.

Note that the injected session factory is responsible for creating the session and that the session is registered in the pipeline context using `context.Extensions.Set<IMySession>(session);`. This will be used later to provide the session to the handlers.


### Registering the behavior

The following code is needed to register the behavior in the receive pipeline.

snippet: configuration


### Providing the session to handlers

While it is possible to use the code `contex.Extensions.Get<IMySession>` in the handler, it is better to provide extension methods on `IMessageHandlerContext` to allow for a more terse syntax. In this sample the methods `.Store<T>` a `.GetSession` are provided:

### Message handlers

One of the benefits of a unit of work is that multiple handlers for the same message will share the same session and commit/rollback together. This is how the handlers look:

## Running the sample

Run the sample. Once running press any key to send messages. Note that for each given message the two message handlers will get the same session instance.
