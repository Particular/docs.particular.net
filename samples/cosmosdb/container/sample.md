This sample shows a client/server scenario using a dynamic container configuration for certain saga types with a fallback to the default container.

## Projects

### SharedMessages

The shared message contracts used by all endpoints.

### Client

* Sends the `StartOrder` message to `Server`.
* Receives and handles the `OrderCompleted` event.

### Server projects

* Receive the `StartOrder` message and initiate an `OrderSaga`.
* `OrderSaga` sends a `ShipOrder` command to `ShipOrderSaga`
* `ShipOrderSaga` requests a timeout with an instance of `CompleteOrder` with the saga data.
* `ShipOrderSaga` replies with `CompleteOrder` when the `CompleteOrder` timeout fires.
* `OrderSaga` publishes an `OrderCompleted` event when the `CompleteOrder` message arrives.

### Persistence config

Configure the endpoint to use Cosmos DB Persistence.

In the non-transactional mode the saga id is used as a partition key and thus the container needs to use `/id` as the partition key path.

## Container Mapping

For `ShipOrder` messages destined to go to the `ShipOrderSaga` the container is overridden at runtime to use `ShipOrderSagaData` container.

For all messages that have a saga type header `ShipOrderSaga` the container is overriden to use `ShipOrderSagaData` container too.
