## Code walk-through

When the default Saga message mappings do not satisfy our needs custom logic can be put in place to allow NServiceBus to find a saga data instance based on which logic best suites our environment.

This sample shows:

* how to perform custom saga finding logic based on custom query logic;
* how to use multiple Unique attributes using the default [RavenDB Unique Constraint bundle](http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=extending%20bundles%20unique-constraints).


### RavenDB setup

This sample requires [RavenDB persistence](/nservicebus/ravendb/) package and a running RavenDB instance configured accordingly.

NServiceBus out of the box does not support saga data with multiple `Unique` attributes, in order to achieve that it is possible to utilize the default RavenDB `UniqueConstraint` Bundle. Follow the [instructions on the RavenDB site](http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=extending%20bundles%20unique-constraints) to correctly install the bundle in your RavenDB server. You also need to configure the client side of the bundle by registering the `UniqueConstraintsStoreListener` as shown above.

INFO: If you are running this sample against an external RavenDB server you need to make sure that the `RavenDB.Bundles.UniqueConstraints` [bundle](http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=extending%20bundles%20unique-constraints) is currently installed according to the [extending RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=server%20extending%20plugins) documentation. If the server side of the plugin is not correctly loaded, you'll notice that the [`SagaNotFoundHandler`](/nservicebus/sagas/saga-not-found.md) will be invoked.


### In Process Raven Host

So that no running instance of RavenDB server is required.

### The Saga

The saga shown in the sample is a very simple order management saga that:

* handles the creation of an order;
* offloads the payment process to a different handler;
* handles the completion of the payment process;
* completes the order;

snippet:TheSagaRavenDB

From the process point of view is important to notice that the saga is not sending to the payment processor the order id instead is sending a payment transaction id, in this scenario we are simulating the fact that a saga can be correlated given more than one unique attribute, such as `OrderId` and `PaymentTransactionId` requiring both to be treated as unique and guaranteed to be so:

snippet:OrderSagaDataRavenDB

We can express attributes uniqueness using the `UniqueConstraint` attribute provided by the RavenDB bundle.

At start-up the sample will send a `StartOrder` message, since we are decorating the saga data class with custom attributes we also need to plug our own logic to find a saga data instance:

snippet:CustomSagaFinderWithUniqueConstraintRavenDB

Building a saga finder requires to define a class that implements the `IFindSagas<TSagaData>.Using<TMessage>` interface. The class will be automatically picked up by NServiceBus at configuration time and used each time a message of type `TMessage`, that is expected to load a saga of type `TSagaData`, is received. The `FindBy` method will be invoked by NServiceBus.

NOTE: In the sample the implementation of the `ConfigureHowToFindSaga` method, that is required, is empty because we are providing a saga finder for each message type that the saga is handling. It is not required to provide a saga finder for every message type, a mix of standard saga mappings and custom saga finding is a valid scenario.
