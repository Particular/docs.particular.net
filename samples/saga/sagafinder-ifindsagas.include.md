Building a saga finder requires to define a class that implements the `IFindSagas<TSagaData>.Using<TMessage>` interface. The class will be automatically picked up by NServiceBus at configuration time and used each time a message of type `TMessage`, that is expected to load a saga of type `TSagaData`, is received. The `FindBy` method will be invoked by NServiceBus.
