A saga finder is a class that implements `IFindSagas<TSagaData>.Using<TMessage>`. The class will be detected automatically by NServiceBus at endpoint configuration time. The `FindBy` method will be invoked by NServiceBus each time a message of type `TMessage` is received by a saga which stores its state using an instance of the `TSagaData` type.
