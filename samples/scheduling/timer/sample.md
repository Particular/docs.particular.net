This sample illustrates the use a [.NET Timer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.timer) to trigger scheduled tasks. To leverage the benefits of [NServiceBus retries](/nservicebus/recoverability/) and [consistency of outgoing messages with the transport transaction](/transports/transactions.md), the tasks are implemented as regular message handlers. This also gives full traceability of the invoked tasks in platform tools like [ServicePulse](/servicepulse/) and [ServiceInsight](/serviceinsight/).
