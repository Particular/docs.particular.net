This sample demonstrates how the Outbox feature works to ensure the atomic processing of a message in RabbitMQ, ensuring that messages sent and received are kept consistent with any modifications made to business data in a database.

This sample uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to provide dependencies. It is not necessary to have installed instances of RabbitMQ or SQL Server.

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. If running Docker on Windows, [set Docker to use Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).
4. In the sample directory, execute the following to set up the RabbitMQ and SQL Server instances:

```dos
> docker-compose up --detach
```

Once complete, the RabbitMQ administration can be reached via [http://localhost:15672/](http://localhost:15672/) with username `rabbitmq` and password `rabbitmq`.

A connection to the SQL Server instance can be made using Server name `localhost,11433`, login `sa`, and password `NServiceBus!`. If connecting with [SQL Server Management Studio](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DownloadSQLServerExpress.aspx), adjust the Connection Properties either by unchecking the **Encrypt connection** checkbox, or checking the **Trust server certificate** box.


## Running the project

The code consists of a single NServiceBus endpoint project, which simulates receiving duplicated messages (normally received due to at-least-once delivery guarantees of the message broker) and processing them under three different circumstances.

1. Without protection, resulting in duplicated processing of messages.
2. Using the Outbox but with a maximum message concurrency of `1`.
3. Using the Outbox but with multiple messages being processed simultaneously, relying on the concurrency exception thrown by the database to ensure exactly-once successful processing of messages.

Selecting each step is accomplished via commenting and uncommenting code in the **Program.cs** file:

snippet: SampleSteps


### Step 1: No protection

First, run the sample as-is. It's easy to see from the console output that each MessageId is processed twice. The endpoint has no way to know that it's handling duplicated messages.

```
Endpoint started. Press Enter to send 5 sets of duplicate messages...

Processing MessageId f4589be7-efaa-4d7b-8fc7-414ac6e5ddfa
Processing MessageId f4589be7-efaa-4d7b-8fc7-414ac6e5ddfa
Processing MessageId 78c4be6d-02f1-4dc6-9aa0-e1298dcb28f9
Processing MessageId 78c4be6d-02f1-4dc6-9aa0-e1298dcb28f9
Processing MessageId 96ed249b-ac80-4eea-be16-eede5f368b09
Processing MessageId 96ed249b-ac80-4eea-be16-eede5f368b09
Processing MessageId 95c6f325-22e2-4832-8a2a-0988ce318f40
Processing MessageId 95c6f325-22e2-4832-8a2a-0988ce318f40
Processing MessageId 1333e38d-b076-41e1-92d6-a2b7a699f62f
Processing MessageId 1333e38d-b076-41e1-92d6-a2b7a699f62f
Press any key to exit
```

The message handler also writes the received MessageId to the **BusinessObject** table in the database, as a simulation of writing business data. To see it, execute `select * from BusinessObject` when connected to the database:

| Id | MessageId |
|----|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | f4589be7-efaa-4d7b-8fc7-414ac6e5ddfa |
| 2 | f4589be7-efaa-4d7b-8fc7-414ac6e5ddfa |
| 3 | 78c4be6d-02f1-4dc6-9aa0-e1298dcb28f9 |
| 4 | 78c4be6d-02f1-4dc6-9aa0-e1298dcb28f9 |
| 5 | 96ed249b-ac80-4eea-be16-eede5f368b09 |
| 6 | 96ed249b-ac80-4eea-be16-eede5f368b09 |
| 7 | 95c6f325-22e2-4832-8a2a-0988ce318f40 |
| 8 | 95c6f325-22e2-4832-8a2a-0988ce318f40 |
| 9 | 1333e38d-b076-41e1-92d6-a2b7a699f62f |
| 10 | 1333e38d-b076-41e1-92d6-a2b7a699f62f |

NOTE: **TIP:** Between runs, it's helpful to execute `delete from BusinessObject` to clear out the table.


### Step 2: Outbox, 1 message at a time

Next, uncomment the line in **Program.cs** commented as Step 2, which enables the Outbox feature.

It's clear from the console output that each MessageId is only processed a single time, and the message handler does not execute for the duplicate messages:

```
Endpoint started. Press Enter to send 5 sets of duplicate messages...

Processing MessageId 4d9b207b-f7e3-48f3-a8a9-8bf00afe0bd5
Processing MessageId cfda075b-2ebd-4256-b127-20fbf719873c
Processing MessageId 48cb433c-2cda-4835-a40c-1f06e7c4ace5
Processing MessageId 93132c07-e39d-4eb1-9d34-db4dee493f17
Processing MessageId 247706a4-c231-441c-b5fd-9f2defe6bb6f
Press any key to exit
```

The same is true in the database:

| Id | MessageId |
|----|--------------------------------------|
| 11 | 4d9b207b-f7e3-48f3-a8a9-8bf00afe0bd5 |
| 12 | cfda075b-2ebd-4256-b127-20fbf719873c |
| 13 | 48cb433c-2cda-4835-a40c-1f06e7c4ace5 |
| 14 | 93132c07-e39d-4eb1-9d34-db4dee493f17 |
| 15 | 247706a4-c231-441c-b5fd-9f2defe6bb6f |

### Step 3: Concurrent Outbox

Lastly, comment out the line in **Program.cs** commented as Step 3, so that the endpoint is no longer limited to concurrently processing only one message at a time. The default concurrency level (2 * the number of logical processors) will now be used.

The resulting console output will likely be difficult to follow, as different threads competing to commit transactions involving the same MessageId in the `Samples_RabbitMQ_Outbox_OutboxData` table will result in SqlExceptions being thrown:

```
NServiceBus.RecoverabilityExecutor Immediate Retry is going to retry message '01dc0013-6954-4289-9351-073b2008a17c' because of an exception:
System.Exception: Failed to ExecuteNonQuery. CommandText:

insert into [dbo].[Samples_RabbitMQ_Outbox_OutboxData]
(
    MessageId,
    Operations,
    PersistenceVersion
)
values
(
    @MessageId,
    @Operations,
    @PersistenceVersion
) ---> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK__Samples___C87C0C9D6CE4EEA0'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.Samples_RabbitMQ_Outbox_OutboxData'. The duplicate key value is (01dc0013-6954-4289-9351-073b2008a17c).
The statement has been terminated.
```

After hitting one of these errors, the message is retried, and as the Outbox lookup in the `Samples_RabbitMQ_Outbox_OutboxData` reveals that the message was already processedm successfully, it will skip executing the message handler again.

The database output in the `BusinessObject` table will be the same.

## Code walk-through

In **Program.cs**, an NServiceBus endpoint is created and configured to use the RabbitMQ transport, connecting to the broker instance hosted in Docker:

snippet: ConfigureTransport

Next, [SQL Persistence](/persistence/sql/) is configured to connect to the Microsoft SQL Server instance hosted in Docker. SQL Server will store the storage for the Outbox feature in the `Samples_RabbitMQ_Outbox_OutboxData` table, as well as simulated business data in the `BusinessObject` table.

A non-standard port `11433` is used in case another SQL Server instance is already running on the machine:

snippet: ConfigurePersistence

**MyHandler.cs** contains the message handler, which shows a bare-bones example of [accessing business data via SQL Persistence](/persistence/sql/accessing-data.md) using ADO.NET, so that the business data is manipulated using the same SQL connection and transaction used by NServiceBus for the Outbox data.

snippet: Handler

The message handler:

1. Logs the `MessageId` to the console.
2. Retrieves the `SynchronizedStorageSession` in use by NServiceBus, containing the `DbConnection` and `DbTransaction` currently in use.
3. Inserts the `MessageId` into the `BusinessObject` table.

NOTE: It's absolutely essential that business data is manipulated using the same connection and transaction that NServiceBus opens to manage the Outbox data. The Outbox feature relies on combining the manipulation of Outbox and business data in the same local database transaction to guarantee consistency between messaging operations and database manipulations within the scope of processing a message.


## Cleaning up

Once finished with the sample, the RabbitMQ and SQL Server instances can be cleaned up using:

```dos
> docker-compose down
```
