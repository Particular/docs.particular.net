> NServiceBus integrates with ASP.NET Core 3.x [using `GenericHost`](/nservicebus/hosting/extensions-hosting.md). For older versions of ASP.NET Core use the community package [Community.NServiceBus.WebHost](https://github.com/timbussmann/Community.NServiceBus.WebHost). ASP.NET Core 2.x has a race condition and the community package implements a workaround. It's recommended to upgrade to ASP.NET Core 3.0 and use NServiceBus.Extensions.Hosting package.
