This sample will report the following metrics to Azure Application Insight:

 * Fetched messages per second
 * Failed messages per second
 * Successful messages per second
 * Average message processing time
 * Average critical time

For a detailed explanation of these metrics see [Metrics - Metrics captured](/nservicebus/operations/metrics.md#metrics-captured).
