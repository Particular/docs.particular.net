This sample demonstrates how to enable an NServiceBus endpoint to receive messages sent by a native (i.e. non-NServiceBus-based) implementation.

In this sample, an external system sends a message to an SQS queue using the Amazon SQS SDK. In order for NServiceBus to be able to consume this message, a `MessageTypeFullName` message attribute must be present. Other attributes are also included to demonstrate how to access those from handlers or behaviors in the pipeline.

On the receiving end, an NServiceBus endpoint is listening to the queue and has a handler in place to handle messages of type `SomeNativeMessage`.

First, the message will be intercepted in the incoming logical message context as there is a behavior in place:

The code to register the above behavior is:

snippet: RegisterBehaviorInPipeline

Next, the handler is invoked. The handler code can also access the native message and its attributes.

Note: The message attribute `MessageTypeFullName` might not be available anymore in the `MessageAttributes` collection in recoverability scenarios. Instead, it will be part of the `Headers` collection.

## Replies

To enable the NServiceBus endpoint to [reply](/nservicebus/messaging/reply-to-a-message.md) back to a native queue, a reply-to address must be provided. To see this in action manually create a queue called `my-native-endpoint` in AWS and uncomment the line in the sender that adds the `ReplyToAddress` message attribute. The receiver uses a behavior to transfer the reply-to address in the native attribute to the [`NServiceBus.ReplyToAddress` header](/nservicebus/messaging/headers.md#messaging-interaction-headers-nservicebus-replytoaddress) that NServiceBus uses to route replies:

After running the sample use the AWS management console to view the replies sent back to the native queue.
