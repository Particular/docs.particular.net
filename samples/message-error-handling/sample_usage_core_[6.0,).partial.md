In Versions 6 and above the `IManageMessageFailures` is deprecated and there's no direct way to manage custom exceptions. The Recoverability API allows for much easier configuration of immediate and delayed retries however finer-grain control can be achieved by writing a custom Behavior and have it executed as step in the message handling pipeline.
