[Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) (App Insights) provides monitoring and alerting capabilities that can be leveraged to monitor the health of NServiceBus endpoints.

This sample shows how to capture NServiceBus OpenTelemetry traces and export them to App Insights. The sample simulates message load as well as a 10% failure rate on processing messages.

## Prerequisites

This sample requires an App Insights connection string.

Note: Although the sample uses Azure Application Insights, the solution itself does not require an Azure message transport. This example uses the [Learning Transport](/transports/learning/) but could be modified to run on any [transport](/transports/).

## Running the sample

1. Create an Application Insights resource in Azure
2. Copy the connection string from the Azure portal dashboard into the sample
3. Start the sample endpoint
4. Press any key to send a message, or <kbd>ESC</kbd> to quit

### Reviewing traces

1. On the Azure portal dashboard, open the _Investigate_ → _Performance_ panel
2. Drill into the samples
3. Review the custom properties

### Reviewing meters

1. Open the Azure portal dashboard for the configured Application Insight instance
2. Navigate to _Monitoring_ → _Metrics_
3. Add metrics with the following information:
- Metric Namespace: `azure.applicationinsights`
- Metrics:
  - `nservicebus.messaging.successes`
  - `nservicebus.messaging.failures`
  - `nservicebus.messaging.fetches`

NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the meter data to populate to Azure. Meters will only appear on the dashboard once they have reported at least one value.

## Code walk-through

The OpenTelemetry instrumentation is enabled on the endpoint.

snippet: enable-open-telemetry

### Tracing

The endpoint configures an OpenTelemetry trace provider that includes the `NServiceBus.Core` source and exports traces to Azure Monitor.

snippet: enable-tracing

### Meters

The endpoint also configures an OpenTelemetry meter provider that includes the `NServiceBus.Core` meter and exports data to Azure Monitor.

snippet: enable-meters

#### Meter shim

NOTE: The Azure Monitor exporter package does not currently support exporting meter data. The sample includes custom code to collect the meter.

The custom meter exporter captures all meters that begin with `nservicebus.` of the `long` sum type, and forwards them to a `TelemetryClient`.

snippet: custom-meter-exporter

This exporter is installed into the meter provider builder with a custom extension method. The exporter is wrapped by a `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` instance that executes the exporter once every 10 seconds.

NOTE: The shim passes `QueueName` as a custom dimension which allows filtering the graphs in Application Insights. Multi-dimensional metrics are not enabled by default. Check [the Azure Monitor documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/get-metric#enable-multi-dimensional-metrics) for instructions on how to enable this feature.
