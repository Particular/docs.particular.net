This sample shows how to configure an NServiceBus endpoint to link OpenTelemetry traces and logs together.

## Configuration

First, configure OpenTelemetry to capture NServiceBus traces:

snippet: otel-config

In this example, all telemetry is sent to a `ConsoleExporter`, but any OpenTelemetry-compliant exporter will work.

Next, connect the logs emitted by the application to the traces as follows:

snippet: otel-logging

This will apply the OpenTelemetry logging format to all the logs. More importantly, it will [correlate all logs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/overview/#log-correlation) to the active traces.
This means that each log statement will include a `TraceId` and `SpanId` as part of the log entry.

Lastly, the NServiceBus endpoint must enable the OpenTelemetry instrumentation:

snippet: otel-nsb-config

## Running the sample

When running the sample, the following log statement from the message handler:

snippet: log-statement

will lead to the following output:

```
 info: MyMessageHandler[0]
 Received message #54
 LogRecord.Timestamp:               2022-06-28T09:02:34.5342602Z

 [Scope.0]:ParentId: e595cc6a4d9b0768
```

The console will also show information for the captured traces:

```
