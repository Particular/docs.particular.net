This sample demonstrates:

- how to integrate NServiceBus with an ASP.NET Core Web API project
- a simple back-end process running in the .NET Core generic host
- the built-in tools used to inject dependencies into message handler classes

## Front-end

The front-end project hosts a simple web page that contains a form. When the form is submitted, a message is sent to the back-end application via NServiceBus for processing. 

The front-end uses the .NET Core generic host to host an NServiceBus endpoint and ASP.NET Core WebAPI controllers. The endpoint is configured as a [send only](/nservicebus/hosting/) endpoint as it does not need to process any messages. There is routing configured for a single message type; `SomeMessage` messages get routed to `Sample.BackEnd`.

The WebAPI controller is able to take a dependency on `IMessageSession` and use it to send messages to the backend.

## Back-end

The back-end project hosts an NServiceBus endpoint which processes messages sent from the front-end. When handling each message it relies on a service that is registered with the host's service collection.

The back-end uses the same API as the front-end to register an NServiceBus endpoint with the generic host.

Additionally, it registers an important calculation service with the host's service collection.

The NServiceBus message handler is able to take a dependency on the registered service and use it when handling the message.
