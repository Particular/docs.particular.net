Run the solution. A single console application starts up: `Server`.

## Code walk-through

When the endpoint is started a `CancellationToken` is passed in from a `CancellationTokenSource`

snippet: StartingEndpointWithCancellationToken

A message is sent to the endpoint once the endpoint starts which triggers a long-running message handler:

snippet: LongRunningMessageHandler

Once a key is pressed, the `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel` method is called to: signal the cancellation token, stop the long running handler, and shut down the endpoint.
