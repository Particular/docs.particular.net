In this sample, the SQL Server Transport is used in conjunction with SQL Persistence. The sample shows how to use the same database connection for both transport and persistence operations, and how to access the SQL connection from within a message handler to persist business objects to the database.


## Prerequisites

 1. Make sure an instance of SQL Server Express is installed and accessible as `.\SQLEXPRESS`.
 1. Create a database named `shared` and add two schemas to it: `sender` and `receiver` (schemas are stored under the *Security* directory in the SQL Server Management Studio database tree).
 1. Execute the **Receiver.Orders.sql** script, found in the solution root directory, against the database to create the `[receiver].[Orders]` table:

snippet: OrdersTableSQL


## Procedure

 1. Start the Sender and Receiver projects.
 1. In the Sender's console notice the `Press <enter> to send a message` text when the app is ready.
 1. Hit <enter>.
 1. On the Receiver console notice that order was submitted.
 1. On the Sender console notice that the order was accepted.
 1. Finally, after a couple of seconds, on the Receiver console notice that the timeout message has been received.
 1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and go to the `shared` database. Verify that there is a row in the saga state table (`receiver.OrderLifecycleSaga`) and in the orders table (`receiver.Orders`)


## Code walk-through

This sample contains three projects:

 * Shared - A class library containing common code including the messages definitions.
 * Sender - A console application responsible for sending the initial `OrderSubmitted` message and processing the follow-up `OrderAccepted` message.
 * Receiver - A console application responsible for processing the order message.

Sender and Receiver use different schemas within one database. This creates a separation on logical level (schemas can be secured independently) while retaining the benefits of having a single physical database. Each schema contains, apart from business data, queues for the NServiceBus endpoint and tables for NServiceBus persistence. If no schema is specified, the transport will default to using the `dbo` schema.


### Sender project

The Sender does not store any data. It mimics the front-end system where orders are submitted by the users and passed as messages to the back-end. It is configured to use the SQL Server transport with SQL persistence. The transport is configured to use a non-standard schema `sender` and to send messages addressed to the `receiver` endpoint to a different schema.

The connection strings for both persistence and transport need to be exactly the same.

### Receiver project

The Receiver mimics a back-end system. It is also configured to use the SQL Server transport with SQL persistence, but with a different schema.

snippet: ReceiverConfiguration

When the message arrives at the Receiver, a `TransactionScope` is created that encompasses

 * Dequeuing the message
 * Accessing the shared connection and persisting business data using [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper)
 * Persisting saga data of `OrderLifecycleSaga`
 * Sending the reply message and the timeout request

snippet: Timeout

The shared session is managed by NServiceBus, so there is no need to explicitly commit a transaction or dispose the connection.

snippet: StoreUserData

With SQL persistence, the `OrderLifecycleSaga` inherits from `SqlSaga`.

snippet: Saga


### Script Output

Both Sender and Receiver projects contain an attribute in the **AssemblyInfo.cs** file which instructs the SQL persister to generate table creation scripts for only Microsoft SQL Server.

snippet: SqlPersistenceSettings

After opening the Sender or Receiver project directory in Windows File Explorer, the SQL scripts generated by the SQL persister at build time can be viewed in the `bin\Debug\NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql` directory.
