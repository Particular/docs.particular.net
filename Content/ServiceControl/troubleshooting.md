1. If there is a service called "Particular.Management" uninstall previous versions of ServiceInsight beta (can be located and uninstalled in Control Panel > Programs as "Particular Software ServiceInsight";

### Unable to connect to ServiceControl from either ServiceInsight or ServicePulse

1. In Computer Management > Services, check that the Windows Service "Particular ServiceControl" is running
1. In any browser or HTTP client, enter a GET request for the ServiceControl HTTP API (default URI: `http://localhost:33333/api`). 
1. You should get a valid response with JSON data containing ServiceControl default settings.
1. Verify that firewall settings do not block access to the ServiceControl port (default: 33333) and that the default URI is accessible and responsive from a browser / HTTP client from the machine on which ServicePulse or ServiceInsight is trying to connect to ServiceControl
