NOTE: this article relates to ServiceMatrix v1.0 (NServiceBus Studio) and NServiceBus 3.x



In the [previous section](getting-started---fault-tolerance.md) we learnt about fault tolerance.

Now that we've gone through the basics of NServiceBus communication and configuration, let's move on to publish/subscribe.

![Full Solution Builder](GettingStarted11.png)

There are only a few steps needed to introduce pub/sub and make your solution look like the one appearing above.

1.  Right click your SubmitOrderProcessor component and select "Publish
    Event...". Type "OrderAccepted" for the name of the event and press
    Enter.
2.  Right click the OrderAccepted event you just created and select "Add
    Subscriber...". Type "Billing" for the name of the new service and
    press Enter.
3.  Create a new NServiceBus Host endpoint called "Billing" and deploy
    the OrderAcceptedProcessor component from the Billing service to
    that endpoint. See [a
    refresher](getting-started---creating-a-new-project.md) on how to do
    this. At this point, your solution structure should look the same as
    the picture on the right.
4.  Add code to the SubmitOrderProcessor in Sales to publish the event:


```C#
using System;
using Amazon.Contract.Sales;
using NServiceBus;
using Amazon.InternalMessages.Sales;

namespace Amazon.OrderProcessing.Sales
{
    public partial class SubmitOrderProcessor
    {
        partial void HandleImplementation(SubmitOrder message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Sales received " + message.GetType().Name);
            Bus.Publish<OrderAccepted>();
        }
    }
}
```

 Your solution should compile, so run it using F5.

Lay out the various consoles and web-UI so that you can see them all, then click "About" a couple of times to watch how it runs:

And there you are: publish/subscribe messaging is working!

Try doing another one yourself: have Billing publish an OrderBilled event, and have yet another service (call it "Shipping") subscribe to it. Create another endpoint to host Shipping or deploy the component to OrderProcessing or Billing. Have Shipping subscribe to the OrderAccepted event and deploy the corresponding component to the same endpoint.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to add the call to Bus.Publish in Billing's OrderAcceptedProcessor.

Once you're done, run it, and see that everything works.

Return to Visual Studio, right click your endpoints, and select "Show Diagram". You should see visualizations of the message flows like this:

As you see, it's very easy to get started with NServiceBus. You're all set now and can build your own distributed systems with NServiceBus.

Known issues
------------

The Visual Studio tooling is still in its early phases and continuing to evolve. Currently it doesn't support renaming well, requiring quite a lot of manual work to get things back in sync. Also, if you make changes to the code structure, it isn't able to synchronize with those changes. For that reason, think of it as more of an accelerator, allowing you to get a new NServiceBus solution set up quickly, but then requiring you to continue with code-only development.

The tooling will improve over time, allowing it to become a more integral part of ongoing development, but in the meantime, it's a good idea to sign up to our discussion group. Any time you have a question, or are wondering why things work a certain way, there will always somebody who is happy to help you out.
