To see how to encrypt message data, open the [Encryption sample](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.Msmq.Samples/tree/master/Encryption)
.

## Run the solution.

You will see two console applications start up.

### Endpoint1 

Which outputs

```
MessageWithSecretData sent. 
```

### Endpoint2 

Which outputs

```
I know your secret - it's 'betcha can't guess my secret'
SubSecret: My sub secret
CreditCard: 312312312312312 is valid to 3/11/2015 5:21:59 AM
CreditCard: 543645546546456 is valid to 3/11/2016 5:21:59 AM
```

## Code walk-through

### The message contract

Starting with the Shared project, open the `MessageWithSecretData.cs` file and look at the following code:

```C#
public class MessageWithSecretData : IMessage
{
  public WireEncryptedString Secret { get; set; }
}
```

Note that it contains a single property of the type WireEncryptedString. This is an NServiceBus type specifying that the contents of the property are encrypted on the wire when transmitted by NServiceBus.

### How is encryption enabled. 

Open either one of the `Program.cs`. You will notice the line 

    busConfiguration.RijndaelEncryptionService("gdDbqRpqdRbTs3mhdZh9qCaDaxJXl+e6");

This code indicates that encryption should use the specified key.

Note: The key specified must be the same in the configuration of all processes that are communicating encrypted information, both on the sending and on the receiving sides. Open the app.config file of the server project and verify that the key is the same. This can be mitigated by defining multiple decryption keys, see [Encryption](encryption.md) 

### The message on the wire

Now run `Endpoint1` on its own (i.e. don't start `Endpoint2`).

Go to the server queue (called "EncryptionSampleEndpoint1") and examine the message in it. Read how to do this in the
[FAQ](how-can-i-see-the-queues-and-messages-on-a-machine.md) . Your message should look like this:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<Messages xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
          xmlns="http://tempuri.net/Messages">
  <MessageWithSecretData>
    <Secret>
      <EncryptedValue>
         <EncryptedBase64Value>+eeBont5Lzlre4cxDi8QT/M6EbAGxTerniqywbpLBVA=</EncryptedBase64Value>
         <Base64Iv>u8n8ds0Ssf/AdJCxpOG7AQ==</Base64Iv>
      </EncryptedValue>
    </Secret>
  </MessageWithSecretData>
</Messages>
```
