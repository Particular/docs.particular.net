<span id="docs-internal-guid-72e49bdf-6d01-3691-bec4-407660e65f53">ServiceMatrix is an accelerator, allowing you to get a new NServiceBus solution set up quickly, but then requiring you to continue with code-only development.</span>

<span id="docs-internal-guid-72e49bdf-6d01-3691-bec4-407660e65f53">The Visual Studio tooling will continue to evolve and improve over time, allowing it to become a more integral part of on-going development. A few current issues: </span>

-   <span id="docs-internal-guid-72e49bdf-6d01-3691-bec4-407660e65f53">If
    you have both Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2012 installed,
    you can only install ServiceMatrix on one Visual Studio
    version.</span>

-   <span id="docs-internal-guid-72e49bdf-6d01-3691-bec4-407660e65f53">If
    you make changes to the code in Solution Explorer like adding files
    or renaming files and classes, ServiceMatrix cannot synchronize with
    those changes.</span>
