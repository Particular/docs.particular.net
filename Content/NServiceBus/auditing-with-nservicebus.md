The distributed nature of parallel message-driven systems makes them more difficult to debug than their sequential, synchronous, and centralized counterparts. For these reasons, NServiceBus provides built-in message auditing for every endpoint. Just tell NServiceBus that you want auditing and it will capture a copy of every received message.

Configuring auditing
--------------------

To turn on auditing in V3 and earlier versions, add the attribute
"ForwardReceivedMessagesTo" to the UnicastBusConfig section of an endpoint's configuration file. In V4 there are a couple of ways to turn on auditing. You can do so in the endpoint configuration but it now has its very own configuration element, as shown:


```XML
<!--In version 3.X use the ForwardReceivedMessageTo Attribute-->
<UnicastBusConfig 
      ForwardReceivedMessagesTo="auditqueue@adminmachine">
  <MessageEndpointMappings>
    <!-- rest of your configuration here -->
  </MessageEndpointMappings>
</UnicastBusConfig>
```

 V4 also supports setting up the error queue and the audit queue at the machine level in the registry. Use the
[Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings](managing-nservicebus-using-powershell.md) PowerShell commandlet to set these values at a machine level. When set at machine level, the setting is not required in the endpoint configuration file for messages to be forwarded to the audit queue.

NServiceBus then forwards all messages arriving at the given endpoint to the queue called "AuditQueue" on the machine called "AdminMachine". You can specify any queue on any machine, although only one is supported.

What you choose to do with those messages is now up to you: save them in a database, do custom logging, etc. The important thing is that you now have a centralized record of everything that is happening in your system while maintaining all the benefits of keep things distributed.

Turning off auditing
--------------------

If the auditing settings are in app.config, remove them or comment them out.

If the machine level auditing is turned on, clear the value for the string value AuditQueue under HKEYLOCALMACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\ParticularSoftware\\ServiceBus.

If running 64 bit, in addition to the above, also clear the value for AuditQueue under HKEYLOCALMACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\ParticularSoftware\\ServiceBus.

Message headers
---------------

Custom headers are attached to each message. You can examine them in the audit queue using a third-party tool for MSMQ.
