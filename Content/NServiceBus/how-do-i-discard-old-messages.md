If a message cannot be received by the target process in the given time frame, including all time in queues and in transit, you may want to discard the message.

To discard a message when a specific time interval has elapsed:

â€‹


```C#
[TimeToBeReceived("00:01:00")] // Discard after one minute
[Recoverable]
public class MyMessage { }
```



<div id="rate_article_container">
<div id="rate_article">
