Getting the source
==================

Cloning the git repository
--------------------------

If you want all the source for all versions of NServiceBus you should
"Clone the repository". The recommended approaches are

-   Using [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
-   Using the [Git command
    line](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)

Downloading a zip
-----------------

GitHub supports downloading a zip file of the source. The convention is
<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/archive/{branchOrTagName}.zip. So for example</span>

-   <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">The current
    develop branch
    </span>[https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/archive/develop.zip](https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/archive/develop.zip)
-   The current master branch is
    [https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/archive/master.zip)
-   The 3.3.8 tag is
    [https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/archive/3.3.8.zip](https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/archive/3.3.8.zip)

Building NServiceBus 4
======================

See "Building" in the Readme.md file at the root of the repository

Building NServiceBus 3
======================

To build NServiceBus 3 from its source files, download the source files from
[github](https://github.com/NServiceBus/NServiceBus/zipball/develop) to get the latest unstable build, or retrieve the latest stable build source code from the [downloads page](http://nservicebus.com/downloads.aspx).

Build NServiceBus options
-------------------------

You can build NServiceBus by either typing .\\build.ps1 in a PowerShell command line or by executing build.bat from the command line. Both files executes default.ps1, which is a PowerShell script file that builds NServiceBus. Default.ps1 is based on the
[psake](http://github.com/psake/psake) build automation tool.

Logical entry points
--------------------

Default.ps1 has five major logical entry points or main tasks:

-   Default: No need to call explicitly. It calls ReleaseNServiceBus
    task

-   ReleaseNServiceBus:

    1.  Compiles all the source code in order.

    2.  Runs the unit tests.

    3.  Prepares the binaries and core-only binaries.

    4.  Creates and publishes the packages to the NuGet gallery (access
        key required).

    5.  Archives release artifacts in zip.

-   JustPrepareBinaries shortens build time:

    1.  Compiles all the source code.

    2.  Prepares the binaries.

-   PrepareBinaries:

    1.  Compiles all the source code in order.

    2.  Runs the unit tests.

    3.  Prepares the binaries and core-only binaries.

-   PrepareReleaseWithoutSamples:

    1.  Compiles all the source code except samples.

    2.  Runs the unit tests.

    3.  Prepares the binaries and core-only binaries.

Entry points for development
----------------------------

Entry points ease the build activity for development:

-   CompileMain - Builds NServiceBus.dll and keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   TestMain - Builds NServiceBus.dll, keeps the output in \\binaries.

-   CompileCore - Builds NServiceBus.Core.dll and keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   TestCore - Builds NServiceBus.Core.dll and keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   CompileContainers - Builds the container dlls for autofac, castle,
    ninject, spring, structuremap, and MS unity and keeps the output in
    respective folders in binaries\\containers.

-   TestContainers - Builds the container dlls for autofac, castle,
    ninject, spring, structuremap, and MS unity and keeps the output in
    respective folders in binaries\\containers and unit tests.

-   CompileWebServicesIntegration - Builds
    NServiceBus.Integration.WebServices.dll and keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   CompileNHibernate - Builds NServiceBus.NHibernate.dll and keeps the
    output in \\binaries.

-   TestNHibernate - Builds NServiceBus.NHibernate.dll, keeps the output
    in \\binaries and unit tests.

-   CompileHosts - Builds NServiceBus.Host.exe and keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   CompileHosts32 - Builds NServiceBus.Host32.exe and keeps the output
    in \\binaries.

-   CompileAzure - Builds NServiceBus.Azure.dll and keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   TestAzure - Builds NServiceBus.Azure.dll, keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   CompileAzureHosts - Builds NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure.dll and
    NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure.HostProcess.exe and keeps the output in
    \\binaries.

-   CompileTools - Builds the tools like XsdGenerator.exe, runner.exe
    and ReturnToSourceQueue.exe and unit tests.

-   CompileSamples - Compiles all the sample projects.

-   CompileSamplesFull - Compiles all the sample projects after
    compiling the source.

Build.ps1 script
----------------

    Build.ps1 is a PowerShell script that is used to execute the default.ps1 NServiceBus build script. Following are examples for executing the Build.ps1 script:

-   Array of strings that takes the names of the tasks to be executed.

    An example of using it: you are working on a sample, making
    modifications in one of the NServiceBus main libraries. To see the
    effect of the change (to build the NServiceBus main libraries),
    execute this:

    ~~~~ {.brush:csharp;}
    NServiceBus> .\build.ps1 @("CompileMain", "CompileSamples")
    ~~~~

    OR

    ~~~~ {.brush:csharp;}
    NServiceBus> .\build.ps1 CompileMain
    ~~~~

-   \$properties = @{} enables passing the properties value when
    invoking default.ps1, for example:

        NServiceBus> .\build.ps1 @("InstallDependentPackages","CompileSamples") @{DownloadDependentPackages=$true}

    \$desc, pass this parameter to see a description of the task, for
    example:

    ~~~~ {.brush:csharp;}
    NServiceBus> .\build.ps1 -desc@("InstallDependentPackages","CompileSamples") @{DownloadDependentPackages=$true}
    ~~~~

The examples assume that you are executing from the NServiceBus root folder at the PowerShell command prompt or the VisualStudio Package Manager console.

Build.bat
---------

Build.bat is an easy way to execute NServiceBus building processes. Examples:

    > build.bat "@(\"CompileMain\",\"CompileSamples\")"
        > build.bat "@(\"InstallDependentPackages\",\"CompileSamples\") @{DownloadDependentPackages=$true}"
