The NServiceBus Host profiles allow you to alter the behavior of your endpoint without recompiling your code. The profiles enable tailoring endpoints for different environments and controlling things like scaling out (running the distributor) and enabling HTTP access (gateway).

 <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">Profiles are only available if you use the </span>[NServiceBus host](the-nservicebus-host.md)<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">
(NServiceBus.Host.exe or the 32-bit only version of it) so this is not applicable if you self host NServiceBus in a website, WCF service, smart client, etc.</span>

Profiles are divided into two main categories, depending on what they control:

-   Environment profiles help to avoid common configuration errors that
    occur when you manually move a system from development to production
    via integration.

     Environment profiles enable easy transition of the system without
    any code changes.

-   Feature profiles turn NServiceBus features on and off, easily and
    with no code changes. For example, turning on and off the
    Distributor, gateway, and timeout manager.

Technically there is no difference between the environment- and feature-related profiles.

Let's look at each of them, starting with the environment-related profiles.

Environment-related profiles
----------------------------

NServiceBus comes with three built-in profiles whose main goal is to adjust the behavior of the host, depending on the environment where the endpoint is running.

You can, of course, [create your own profiles](profiles-for-nservicebus-host.md).

The environmental-related profiles:

-   Lite profile is suitable for running on your development machine,
    possibly inside Visual Studio.

    This profile configures all the persistence like sagas,
    subscriptions, timeouts, etc. to be InMemory which is easy to set up
    but probably not what you want for production.

     Lite also turns the TimeoutManager and Gateway on by default.


    [Installers](http://andreasohlund.net/2012/01/26/installers-in-nservicebus-3-0/)
    are always invoked when running the Lite profile.

     Logging is output to the console.

-   Integration profile is suitable for running your endpoint in
    integration and QA environments.

    Storage is persistent using queues or RavenDB.

     Features like TimeoutManager and gateway are turned off by
    default.

     Installers are invoked to make deployment easy to automate.

     Logging is output to the console by default.

-   Production profile is the default if no explicit profile is defined.

    This profile sets your endpoint up for production use. This means
    that all storage is durable and suitable for scale out.

     Installers are not invoked since your endpoint is probably
    installed as a Windows Service and does not run with elevated
    privileges.

     Installers only run when you install the host or your code runs
    inside Visual Studio in Debug mode.

     Logging is output to a log file in the runtime directory (again,
    because you are probably running it as a Windows Service).

     Performance counters are installed by default.

Feature-related profiles
------------------------

Feature-related profiles that come out of the box :

-   MultiSite turns on the gateway

-   Master makes the endpoint a "master node endpoint".
    <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">This means that it
    runs the gateway for multisite interaction, the timeout manager, and
    the Distributor.
    </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">It
    </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">also starts
    a worker that
    </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">enlists
    with the Distributor.
    </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">It
    can</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">no</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">t
    be combined with the
    w</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">orker or
    d</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">istributor
    profiles.</span>

-   Worker makes the current endpoint enlist as a worker with its
    distributor running on the master node.
    <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">It
    c</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">anno</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">t
    be combined with the
    m</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">aster or
    d</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">istributor
    profiles.</span>

-   Distributor starts the endpoint as a distributor only. This means
    that the endpoint does no actual work and only distributes the load
    among its enlisted workers. It cannot be combined with the Master
    and Worker profiles.

-   PerformanceCounters turns on the NServiceBus-specific performance
    counters. Performance counters are installed by default when running
    in Production profile.

Telling the host which profiles to run
--------------------------------------

To activate a specific profile, when you start the host, pass in the full name of the profile on the command line. Type names are case insensitive. Profiles can be combined by separating them with white space.

So to run your endpoint with the Integration and Master profiles, use this:

    .\NServiceBus.Host.exe nservicebus.integration nservicebus.master

When you install the host as a Windows Service, the profiles used when installing persist and are used every time the host starts. So to install your host with the Production and the MultiSite profiles, use this:

    .\NServiceBus.Host.exe /install nservicebus.production nservicebus.multisite
