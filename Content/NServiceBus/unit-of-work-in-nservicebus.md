When using a framework like NServiceBus you usually need to create your own units of work to avoid having to repeat code in your message handlers. For example, committing NHibernate transactions, or calling SaveChanges on the RavenDB session.

In NServiceBus V2.6 the only hook into the message pipeline was the message modules (see [Jonathan Oliver's post](http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/2010/04/extending-nservicebus-thread-specific-message-modules/)
). This had some quirks since the HandleEndMessage method of the message module is invoked regardless of the outcome, making it hard to decide whether to perform a commit or rollback.

NServiceBus V3.0 introduces a new way to do this, using the IManageUnitsOfWork interface:


```C#
/// <summary>
/// Interface used by NServiceBus to manage units of work as a part of the
/// message processing pipeline.
/// </summary>
public interface IManageUnitsOfWork
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Called before all message handlers and modules.
    /// </summary>
    void Begin();
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Called after all message handlers and modules, if an error has occurred the exception will be passed.
    /// </summary>
    void End(Exception ex = null);
}
```

 The semantics are that Begin() is called when the transport messages enters the pipeline. Remember that a transport message can consist of multiple application messages. This allows you to do any setup that is required. 

The End() method is called when the processing is complete. If there is an exception, it is passed into the method. 

This gives you a way to perform different actions depending on the outcome of the message(s).
