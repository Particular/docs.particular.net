Using the `AutoSubscribe` method, of the `BusConfiguration` instance, is possible to control some options of the message subscriptions engine:

* `DoNotRequireExplicitRouting`: Allows another endpoint to subscribe to messages addressed to the current endpoint;
* `DoNotAutoSubscribeSagas`: Turns off auto subscriptions for sagas. Sagas where not auto subscribed by default before V4;
* `AutoSubscribePlainMessages`: Turns on auto-subscriptions for messages not marked as commands. This was the default before V4;
