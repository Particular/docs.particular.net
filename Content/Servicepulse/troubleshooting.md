1. **ServicePulse is unable to connect to ServiceControl**
	* See [ServiceControl release notes](https://github.com/Particular/ServiceControl/releases/) Troubleshooting section for guidance on detecting ServiceControl HTTP API accessibility
	* Verify that ServicePulse is trying to access the correct ServiceControl URI (based on ServicControl instance URI defined in ServicePulse installation settings)
	* Check that ServicePulse is not blocked from accessing the ServiceControl URI by firewall settings
1. **ServicePulse reports that 0 endpoints are active, although Endpoint plugins were deployed**
	* Make sure you follow the guidance in the section "Deploying Endpoint Plugin in each Endpoint" above
	* Restart the endpoint after copying the Endpoint Plugin files into the endpoint's Bin directory
	* Make sure that the endpoint references NServiceBus 4.0.0 or later
	* Make sure auditing is turned on for the endpoint, and the audited messages are forwarded to the correct audit and error queues monitored by ServiceControl
1. **ASP.Net applications heartbeat failure**

	**Scenario**
	
	After a period of inactivity, a web application (or web role in Azure) endpoint is failing with the message:
	
	*"Endpoint has failed to send expected heartbeat to ServiceControl. It is possible that the endpoint could be down or is unresponsive. If this condition persists, you might want to restart your endpoint"*
	
	When accessed, the web application is working fine. Shortly after accessing the web application, the Heartbeat message is restored and indicates the endpoint status as active.
	
	**Causes and solutions**
	
	The issue is due to the way IIS handles application pools, by default after a certain amount of inactivity the application pools is stopped, or, under certain configurable conditions, the application pool is recycled. IN both cases the ServicePulse heartbeat is not sent anymore until a new web request comes in waking up the web application.
	
	There are two ways to avoid the issue:
	
	1. Configuring IIS to avoid recycling (see possible method [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lucascan/archive/2011/09/30/using-a-windows-azure-startup-script-to-prevent-your-site-from-being-shutdown.aspx));
	1. Use a periodic warm-up HTTP GET to make sure the website is not brought down due to inactivity (the frequency needs to be less than 20 mins, which is the default IIS recycle-on-idle time);

	The suggested approach is the second one. It also has the side benefit of avoiding the "first user after idle time" wake-up response time hit.
