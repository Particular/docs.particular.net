ServicePulse comes with a builtin check that can be installed in each endpoint to enable communication with the ServicePulse monitoring service.

Custom checks can be developed and designed to satisfy all the monitoring needs, keeping in mind that they are intended for monitoring purposes, custom checks can be of 2 main types:

1. Checks that are executed once, and only once at endpoint startup;
1. Checks that are executed periodically;

In order to develop a custom check it is enought to:

1. In Visual Studio, create a new Class Library project;
1. Add the Endpoint Plugin to the project using the NuGet console:
	`install-package ServiceControl.Plugin.CustomChecks -pre`
1. To create a custom check that executes once, on endpoint startup, create a class that inherits from `CustomCheck` class (see sample code below);
1. To create a custom check that executes repeatedly, in defined time intervals, create a class that inherits from `PeriodicCheck` class (see sample code below);
1. Build and deploy the class library dll in the Bin directory of the endpoint you wish to execute these custom checks;
	* You can deploy many custom checks per endpoint, and deploy the same custom checks in as many endpoints as required;

##### Sample Custom Check

```C#
using ServiceControl.Plugin.CustomChecks;
using ServiceControl.Plugin.CustomChecks.Messages;
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace CustomCheckSample
{
    class FtpAvailabilityCheck : CustomCheck
    {
        public static bool isAvailable = false;

        public FtpAvailabilityCheck()
            : base("FTP server availability check", "FTP Server") 
        {
            if (!isAvailable) 
                ReportFailed("The FTP Service is down");
        }
    }

    class FtpStorageDirectoryCheck : PeriodicCheck
    {
        public FtpStorageDirectoryCheck() 
            : base("FTP storage directory check", "FTP Server", TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)){}

        public override CheckResult PerformCheck()
        {
            var dir = @"C:\Checks\FTP";
            if (!Directory.Exists(dir))
            {
                return CheckResult.Failed(string.Format("FTP storage directory '{0}' does not exist", dir));                
            }
            return CheckResult.Pass;
        }
    }
}
```
