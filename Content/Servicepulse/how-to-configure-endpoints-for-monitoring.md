**ServicePulse monitors NServiceBus endpoints for:**

1. Endpoint availability (using heartbeat signals sent from the endpoint);
1. Failed Messages (by monitoring the error queue defined for the endpoints);
1. Custom Checks (defined and developed per application needs);
1. And more (see [An Introduction to ServicePulse for NServiceBus](http://particular.net/blog/an-introduction-to-servicepulse-for-nservicebus) for additional upcoming monitoring features;

**Prerequisites for ServicePulse monitoring of endpoints:**

1. An Endpoint Plugin dll must be deployed in the binaries directory of each NServiceBus endpoint (required for endpoint availability and Custom Checks monitoring);
1. Endpoints must use NServiceBus version 4.0.0 or higher (support for earlier releases will be added in a future release);
1. Auditing must be enabled for all monitored endpoints (see [Auditing With NServiceBus](http://particular.net/articles/auditing-with-nservicebus));
1. All endpoints must forward audited data to a single audit and error queue, that is monitored by a ServiceControl instance;

**Deploying Endpoint Plugins in each Endpoint**

1. The Endpoint Plugin consists of two Nuget Packages:
    * `ServiceControl.Plugin.Heartbeat.dll`
    * `ServiceControl.Plugin.CustomChecks.dll`
1. Get the Endpoint Heartbeat and CustomChecks Plugins using the NuGet console: 
     * `install-package ServiceControl.Plugin.Heartbeat -pre`
     * `install-package ServiceControl.Plugin.CustomChecks -pre`
1. For manual deployment, copy the Endpoint Plugin dll files to each endpoint bin directory (and restart the endpoint to load the plugin);
1. By default, the Endpoint Plugin sends a heartbeat indication to ServiceControl every 30 seconds;
   * If a heartbeat indication is not recevied within 30 seconds, ServicePulse raises an event that indicates the issue;
