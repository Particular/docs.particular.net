Monitoring in NServiceBus is easier than in regular three-tier systems due to the use of queuing and message-based communication. Given the fact that generally messages are an atomic piece of information that drives the system

**Monitoring Primers**

When a system is broken down into multiple processes monitoring becomes a key aspect not only from a system maintenance, DevOps, point of view, but also from the system behavior point of view. Losing control of what the system does and why the system behaves in a certain way can rapidly become a problem hard to manage.

NServiceBus monitoring tools and practices levarage the intrinsic power that a messaging architecture brings to the table to allow an easy and powerfull monitoring process.

When a system is a messaging based system you can quickly identify which process is the bottleneck by examining how many messages are in each queue; you can quickly understand where a message is stuck and why and you can quickly indentify reasons that caused a message to be delivered to a specific endpoint by tracking its route from the beginning to the end.

**Service Level Agreement**

An SLA is, as the name implies, an agreement between the involved parts. When speaking about endpoints and messages an SLA is a mean to express that a given endpoint must consume, handled in NServiceBus terminology, messages within a given amount of time, otherwise the SLA itself is not respected.

**Performance Counters**

Performance Counters are one of the NServiceBus monitoring foundation, Operating System level counters allows us to identify bottlenecks in our endpoints by examining how many messages (on average) are in each queue.

The only issue is that without knowing the rate of messages coming into each queue, and the rate at which messages are being processed from each queue, you can't know how long messages are waiting in each queue, which is the primary indicator of a bottleneck.

Unfortunately, despite the many performance counters Microsoft provides for MSMQ (including messages in queues, machine-wide incoming and outgoing messages per second, and the total messages in all queues), there is no built-in performance counter for the time it takes a message to get through each queue.

*NServiceBus performance counters*

As a part of the NServiceBus installation, two additional performance counters are installed under the new "NServiceBus" category.

* "Critical time" monitors the age of the oldest message in the queue. This takes into account the whole chain, from the message being sent from the client machine until successfully processed by the server. Define an SLA for each of your endpoints and use the CriticalTime counter to make sure you adhere to it.
* "Time to SLA breach" acts as a early warning system to tell you the number of seconds left until the SLA for the particular endpoint is breached. This gives you a system-wide counter that can be monitored without putting the SLA into your monitoring software. Just set that alarm to trigger when the counter goes below X, which is the time that your operations team needs to be able to take actions to prevent the SLA from being breached. To define the endpoint SLA, add the [EndpointSLA] attribute on your endpoint configuration. If self-hosting, use the Configure.SetEndpointSLA() method on the Fluent API instead. All processes running with NServiceBus collect this information and the counters are enabled by default.
Since all performance counters in Windows are exposed via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), it is very straightforward to pull this information into your existing monitoring infrastructure.

Best practices

If the monitored system is designed according to the NServiceBus best practice of having each process (and by corollary each queue) handle only a single message type, you can then know how long each type of messages is waiting in the system. This enables you to provide the business with information on a use-case by use-case basis. The business can, in turn, specify SLA requirements per use case, which can then be monitored.

Based on this information, each process can be scaled independently using the distributor to make sure it stays within required service levels. This is Business Service Management (BSM) at its finest.
