### ServicePulse is unable to connect to ServiceControl

* See [ServiceControl release notes](https://github.com/Particular/ServiceControl/releases/) Troubleshooting section for guidance on detecting ServiceControl HTTP API accessibility
* Verify that ServicePulse is trying to access the correct ServiceControl URI (based on ServiceControl instance URI defined in ServicePulse installation settings)
* Check that ServicePulse is not blocked from accessing the ServiceControl URI by firewall settings


### ServicePulse reports that 0 endpoints are active, although Endpoint plugins were deployed

* Make sure you follow the guidance in [How to configure endpoints for monitoring by ServicePulse](how-to-configure-endpoints-for-monitoring.md)
* Restart the endpoint after copying the Endpoint Plugin files into the endpoint's Bin directory
* Make sure that the endpoint references NServiceBus Version 4.0.0 or later
* Make sure auditing is turned on for the endpoint, and the audited messages are forwarded to the correct audit and error queues monitored by ServiceControl


### ASP.NET applications heartbeat failure


#### Scenario

After a period of inactivity, a web application endpoint is failing with the message:

	`Endpoint has failed to send expected heartbeat to ServiceControl. It is possible that the endpoint could be down or is unresponsive. If this condition persists, you might want to restart your endpoint`

When accessed, the web application is working fine. Shortly after accessing the web application, the Heartbeat message is restored and indicates the endpoint status as active.


#### Causes and solutions

The issue is due to the way IIS handles application pools. By default after a certain period of inactivity the application pool is stopped, or, under certain configurable conditions, the application pool is recycled. In both cases the ServicePulse heartbeat is not sent anymore until a new web request comes in waking up the web application.

There are two ways to avoid the issue:

1. Configuring IIS to avoid recycling
2. Use a periodic warm-up HTTP GET to make sure the website is not brought down due to inactivity (the frequency needs to be less than 20 minutes, which is the default IIS recycle-on-idle time)

Starting from IIS 7.5 and above the above steps can be combined into one by following these steps:

1. Enable `AlwaysRunning` mode for the application pool of the site. Go to the application pool management, open the Advanced Settings under General switch the `Start Mode` to `AlwaysRunning`
1. Enabled Preload for the site itself. Right click on the site, then Manage Site under Advanced Settings in the General settings, switch `Enable Preload` to `true`
1. Install the Application Initialization Module as described here http://www.iis.net/learn/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-8/iis-80-application-initialization
1. Add the following to your web.config under the `<system.webServer>` node

```
<applicationInitialization doAppInitAfterRestart="true" >
<add initializationPage="/" />
</applicationInitialization>
```

In some cases configuring IIS to avoid recycling is not possible. In these cases, the recommended approach is the second one. It also has the side benefit of avoiding the "first user after idle time" wake-up response-time hit.

### Duplicate Endpoints appear in ServicePulse after re-deployment

This may occur when an endpoint is re-deployed or updated to a different installation path (a common procedure by various deployment managers like Octopus etc.)

The installation path of an endpoint is used by ServiceControl and ServicePulse as the default mechanism for generating the unique Id of an endpoint. Changing the installation path of the endpoint affects the generated Id, and causes the system to identify the endpoint as a new and different endpoint.

To workaround this issue see [Override host identifier](/nservicebus/hosting/override-hostid.md)


### After enabling Heartbeat plugins for Version 3 endpoints, ServicePulse reports that endpoints are inactive

Messages that were forwarded to the audit queue by NSB Version 3.x version of the endpoints did not have the `HostId` header available which uniquely identifies the endpoint. Adding the heartbeat plugin for Version 3 endpoints automatically enriches the headers with this `HostId` information using a message mutator. Since the original message that was processed from the audit/error queue did not have this identifier, it is hard to correlate the messages received via the heartbeat that these belong to the same endpoint. Therefore there appears to be a discrepancy in the Endpoints Indicator.

To workaround this issue in order to monitor Version 3 endpoints:

- Add the heartbeat plugin to all Version 3 endpoints, which will add the requisite header with the host information, which ServiceControl can then process.
- Restart ServiceControl to clear the endpoint counter.
