Upgrading ServicePulse from version 1 to version 2 is straightforward. Version 2 is fully compatible with version 1, requiring only the installation of the new version.

## Prerequisites

To take advantage of the new [All Messages](/servicepulse/all-messages.md) area, ensure that you are running ServiceControl version 6.6 or higher and have deployed and configured [Audit instances](/servicecontrol/audit-instances/).

Without Audit instances enabled, the functionality in the All Messages area is restricted to only showing failure messages.


## Upgrade Steps

1. **Download the latest version**:
   Obtain the ServicePulse version 2 installer from the [official download page](https://particular.net/downloads).

2. **Install the new version**:
   Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Verify the installation**:
   Open ServicePulse and confirm that it is running version 2. Check that all existing configurations and data are intact.

4. **Optional - Enable new features**:
   If you are using a ServiceControl version lower than 6.6, consider upgrading ServiceControl to its latest version to take advantage of the functionality of the [All Messages](/servicepulse/all-messages.md) area.
