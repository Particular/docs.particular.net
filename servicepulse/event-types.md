ServicePulse gives an overview of the system health, based on endpoints heartbeats and custom checks, and a detailed view of all the failed messages.

Note: The same information can be consumed, not only via the ServicePulse web interface, but also by subscribing to [custom notifications and alerts from ServiceControl](/servicecontrol/contracts.md).


### Heartbeats


#### HeartbeatStopped

The `HeartbeatStopped` event is published each time the monitoring infrastructure does not receive the heartbeat, from an endpoint, within the expected amount of time.


#### HeartbeatRestored

The `HeartbeatRestored` event is published to notify that a previously stopped heartbeat has been restored and the related endpoint is running as expected.

More details on [Endpoints and Heartbeats in ServicePulse](intro-endpoints-heartbeats.md).


### MessageFailed

The `MessageFailed` event is published to notify that a message has failed all the [Immediate Retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#immediate-retries) steps and all the [Delayed Retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#delayed-retries) steps and has reached the configured error queue. The event itself carries all the details of the failure and has a `MessageStatus` enumeration that details the type of failure:

 * `Failed`: The message has failed and has arrived for the first time in the error queue;
 * `RepeatedFailure`: The message has failed multiple times;
 * `ArchivedFailure`: The message has been archived;

More details on [Failed Message Monitoring in ServicePulse](intro-failed-messages.md).


### Custom Check / Periodic Check

Custom checks allow an endpoint to notify ServicePulse if a business related condition is not met. The endpoint heartbeat signals that the endpoint is running, a custom check can add more information, such as the endpoint is running and can access the external resources required to operate correctly.
