ServicePulse gives an overview of a system's health, based on endpoints heartbeats and custom checks, and a detailed view of failed messages.

Note: The same information can be consumed not only via the ServicePulse web interface, but also by subscribing to [custom notifications and alerts from ServiceControl](/servicecontrol/contracts.md).


### Heartbeats


#### HeartbeatStopped

The `HeartbeatStopped` event is published each time the monitoring infrastructure does not receive a heartbeat from an endpoint within the expected amount of time.


#### HeartbeatRestored

The `HeartbeatRestored` event is published to notify when a previously stopped heartbeat has been restored and the related endpoint is running as expected.

More details on endpoints and heartbeats in ServicePulse](/monitoring/heartbeats/in-servicepulse.md).


### MessageFailed

The `MessageFailed` event is published to notify that a message has failed all the [immediate retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#immediate-retries) steps and all the [delayed retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#delayed-retries) steps and has reached the configured error queue. The event itself carries all the details of the failure and has a `MessageStatus` enumeration that details the type of failure:

 * `Failed`: The message has failed and has arrived for the first time in the error queue;
 * `RepeatedFailure`: The message has failed multiple times;
 * `ArchivedFailure`: The message has been deleted;

More details on [failed message monitoring in ServicePulse](intro-failed-messages.md).


### Custom check / Periodic check

Custom checks allow an endpoint to notify ServicePulse if a business related condition is not met. The endpoint heartbeat signals that the endpoint is running and that a custom check can add more information, for example, that the endpoint is running and can access the external resources required to operate correctly.

## Dashboard screen
