ServicePulse displays a flow diagram of the conversation that contains the message. This illustrates the message and all related messages from the same conversation, along with the nature of the messages and the endpoints involved. Other messages in the conversation can also be viewed and link to their respective details pages.

Each message is represented by a box (node) indicating the message type and displaying details including time information and, optionally, the sending and receiving endpoints. Published events and sent commands have different icons and illustrations.
