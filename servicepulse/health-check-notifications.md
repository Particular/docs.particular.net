Every ServiceControl instance performs periodic internal health checks and raises notifications when the health checks fail. By default, notifications are published as [integration events](/servicecontrol/contracts.md) but it is also possible to deliver them as email messages.


NOTE: Email notifications require ServicePulse version 1.29 or later, and ServiceControl version 4.17 or later.

Email notification settings can be managed from the Configuration page by selecting the Health Check Notifications tab. When configured, emails will be sent only when internal health checks (e.g. trying to reach remote instances or audit ingestion etc.) fail.
