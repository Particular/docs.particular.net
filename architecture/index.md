This guidance describes architectural concepts for building distributed systems both in the cloud and on-premises, and shows how the Particular Service Platform helps organizations follow those concepts, implement specific architectural styles, and make associated technology choices.

## Concepts

Architectural concepts are generally applicable, regardless of which specific technologies or platforms are used. They include, but are not limited to:

- [Messaging](/architecture/messaging.md)
- [Recoverability](/architecture/recoverability.md)
- [Consistency](/architecture/consistency.md)
- [Workflows](/architecture/workflows.md)
- [Hybrid systems](/architecture/hybrid-systems.md)

## Azure

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is a popular cloud platform for building and running distributed systems. The Azure architectural guidance included here focuses on the integration of the Particular Service Platform with Azure technologies and services, with reference to architectural styles and technology choices.

## The Particular Service Platform

The goal of the Platform is to provide a set of tools that make it easier to build and maintain messaging systems. These tools are based on industry-standard [architectural concepts](#concepts) and enable developers to focus on more important challenges, such as gaining a better understanding of their business domains.
