The [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/) highlights the [Well-Architected Framework](/architecture/aws/well-architected.md) as well as several best practices for building cloud solutions with Amazon.

## Architecture styles

The Particular Service Platform supports the messaging patterns recommended by the AWS Architecture Center for the following architectural styles:

* [Event driven architecture](/architecture/aws/event-driven-architecture.md)
* [Microservices architecture](/architecture/aws/microservices.md)
* [Multi-tier architecture](/architecture/aws/multi-tier-architecture.md)
* [Queue based architecture](/architecture/aws/queue-based-architecture.md)

## Technology choices

The Particular Service Platform supports the AWS services required to build distributed, message-driven systems. These articles help make informed technology choices for AWS-focused solutions:

* [Compute](/architecture/aws/compute.md)
* [Data stores](/architecture/aws/data-stores.md)
* [Messaging](/architecture/aws/messaging.md)
* [Observability](/architecture/aws/observability.md)
