## AWS Well-Architected

The [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected) Framework helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads. Itâ€™s built around six pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. The framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs.

NServiceBus helps you achieve the six pillars of the AWS Well-architected Framework in a number of ways.
