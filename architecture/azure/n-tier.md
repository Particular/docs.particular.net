The Azure Architecture Center describes the [N-tier architecture style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/microservices) (also referred to as the "layered" architecture style) as dividing an application into logical layers and physical tiers.

The Particular Service Platform... TBD

### Components

* Front end layer: Often these are web applications or Desktop UIs physically separated from the other layers.
* Business logic layer: Contains the business logic
* Data layer: One or more databases containing all data models of the application.
* Message queue: used for sending commands from upper to lower layers and publishing events from lower layers to upper layers

### Challenges

Physically separating the tiers improves scalability of the application but also introduces higher exposure to network related issues that might affect availability. Message queues help to decouple the layers and increase resiliency across the layers.

The layers in an N-tier architecture style often communicate synchronously to execute business processes. Long-running or heavy workloads can negatively impact the user experience and overall system performance. Asynchronous communication, using messaging, decouples the layer interacting with the user from the layers processing the workload.

Front end layers often need to reflect changes made by other users or processes. Notifications from lower layers must respect the constraint that lower layer must not reference upper layers, and may be hosted separately from upper layers. Messaging may be used to provide event-based notifications from lower layers to upper layers, while following these constraints.
