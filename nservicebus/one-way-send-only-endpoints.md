summary: Use "Send only mode" for endpoints whose only purpose is sending messages
tags:
- SendOnly
---

You would use this for endpoints whose only purpose is sending messages, such as websites. This is the code for starting an endpoint in send only mode.

In Version 3 and version 4:

<!-- import SendOnlyV4 -->

In Version 5:

<!-- import SendOnlyV5 -->

The only configuration when running in this mode is the destination of the messages you're sending. You can configure it [inline or through configuration](how-do-i-specify-to-which-destination-a-message-will-be-sent.md).
