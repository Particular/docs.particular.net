title: Persistence In NServiceBus
summary: Features of NServiceBus requiring persistence include timeouts, sagas, and subscription storage.

Various features of NServiceBus require persistence. Among them are timeouts, sagas, and subscription storage.

Four persistence technologies are in use in NServiceBus:

-   RavenDB
-   [NHibernate](persistence-in-nservicebus.md)
-   In-Memory
-   MSMQ

Read about [installing Raven DB](using-ravendb-in-nservicebus-installing.md) and [how to connect to it](using-ravendb-in-nservicebus-connecting.md) .

## Using NHibernate for persistence

Starting with NServiceBus V3.0, support for NHibernate persistence is located in a separate assembly.  The configuration was then simplified further for V4.0+.

[NHibernate persistence for V3.x](relational-persistence-using-nhibernate.md).

## What's available?

The following table summarizes what is available and how to configure each feature.

| Type                 | In-Memory  | RavenDB   | NHibernate    | MSMQ                                  |
|--------------------  |:---------- |:--------- |:--------------|:------------------------------------- |
| Timeout              | X          | X         | X             | Not supported as of v3.3.0   |
| Subscription         | X          | X         | X             | X                                     |
| Saga                 | X          | X         | X             | -                                     |
| Gateway              | X          | X         | X             | -                                     |
| Distributor          | -          | -         | -             | X                                     |

NOTE: Storing your subscriptions in MSMQ is not suitable for scenarios where you need to scale the endpoint out. The reason is that the subscription queue cannot be shared among multiple endpoints. 

If self hosting, you can configure the persistence technology for each feature. For example, to store subscriptions in-memory and timeouts in RavenDB, use this code:


```C#
static void Main()
{
    Configure.With()
    .Log4Net()
    .DefaultBuilder()
    .XmlSerializer()
    .MsmqTransport()
    .IsTransactional(true)
    .PurgeOnStartup(false)
    .InMemorySubscriptionStorage()
    .UnicastBus()
    .ImpersonateSender(false)
    .LoadMessageHandlers()
    .UseRavenTimeoutPersister()
    .CreateBus()
    .Start(() => Configure.Instance.ForInstallationOn<NServiceBus.Installation.Environments.Windows>().Install());
}

```

and for NServiceBus v4.x

```C#
static void Main()
{
    Configure.Serialization.Xml();

    Configure.Transactions.Enable();

    Configure.With()
    .Log4Net()
    .DefaultBuilder()
    .UseTransport<Msmq>()
    .PurgeOnStartup(false)
    .InMemorySubscriptionStorage()
    .UnicastBus()
    .RunHandlersUnderIncomingPrincipal(false)
    .LoadMessageHandlers()
    .UseRavenTimeoutPersister()
    .CreateBus()
    .Start(() => Configure.Instance.ForInstallationOn<NServiceBus.Installation.Environments.Windows>().Install());
}
```

When you use NServiceBus.Host.exe out of the box, you can utilize one of the available profiles. The following table shows which persistence technology each pre-built profile configures by default. In addition, you can override the configured defaults. Read more about
[profiles](profiles-for-nservicebus-host.md) , [here too](more-on-profiles.md).

The following table summarizes the different persistence technologies being used by the built-in profiles. 

NOTE: Before configuring persistence technology, to avoid overriding your configurations, the profiles check if other types of storage are used.

|:--------------------------------|:--------|:---------------------|:------------|:----------------------------|

## Default persisting technology

The `AsAServer` role activates the timeout manager. This role does not explicitly determine which persisting technology to use. Hence, the default persisting technology for timeout manager (RavenDB) is used.

Similarly to the `AsAServer` role, the various profiles activate the different NServiceBus features, without explicitly configuring the persisting technology.
