Note: In NServiceBus version 6 and above, the context respects the stage hierarchy and only allows adding new entries in the scope of the current context. A child behavior (later in the pipeline chain) can read and even modify entries set by a parent behavior (earlier in the pipeline chain) but entries added by the child cannot be accessed from the parent.
