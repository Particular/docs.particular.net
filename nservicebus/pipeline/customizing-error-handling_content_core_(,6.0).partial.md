`IManageMessageFailures` allows custom actions when messages continue to fail after the [Immediate Retries](/nservicebus/recoverability/#immediate-retries) have been attempted.

WARNING: When enabling this extension, second-level retries will not be invoked. Versions 6 and above offer better control of customization through the message pipeline.
