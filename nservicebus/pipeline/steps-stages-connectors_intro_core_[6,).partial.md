Each pipeline is composed of *steps*. A step is an identifiable value in the pipeline used to programmatically define order of execution. Each step represents a behavior which will be executed at the given place within the pipeline. Add additional behavior to the pipeline by registering a new step or replace the behavior of an existing step with the custom implementation.
