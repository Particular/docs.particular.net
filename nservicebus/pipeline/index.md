## Pipeline customization

There are several ways to customize the pipelines with varying levels of complexity.

* [Manipulate the pipeline with behaviors](/nservicebus/pipeline/manipulate-with-behaviors.md)
* [Steps, stages and connectors](/nservicebus/pipeline/steps-stages-connectors.md)
* [Message mutators](/nservicebus/pipeline/message-mutators.md)
* [Abort the pipeline](/nservicebus/pipeline/aborting.md)
* [React to pipeline events](/nservicebus/pipeline/events.md)

Unit testing of custom extensions is supported by [the `NServiceBus.Testing` library](/nservicebus/testing/#testing-a-behavior).
