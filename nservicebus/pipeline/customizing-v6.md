NServiceBus version 6 splits the existing pipelines into smaller and better composable units called "Stages". A stage is a group of steps acting on the same level of abstraction. This allows you to define a step working with the "incoming physical" message before it has been deserialized or a step which is executed before and after each handler invocation (remember: there can be multiple message handlers per message). You'll find more information about the existing stages later in this article.

You can extend the pipeline with a custom behavior implementing `Behavior<TContext>`. `TContext` is the context of the stage that the behavior belongs to.

snippet:SamplePipelineBehavior

In the above code snippet the `SampleBehavior` class derives from `Behavior<IIncomingLogicalMessageContext>`. This tells the framework to execute this behavior after the incoming raw message has been deserialized and a matching message type has been found. At runtime, the pipeline will call the `Invoke` method of each registered behavior passing in as arguments the current message context and an action to invoke the next behavior in the pipeline.

Warning: Each behavior is responsible to call the next step in the pipeline chain by invoking `next`.


## Add a new step

To add your custom behavior to the pipeline, you need to define a step for it:

snippet:NewPipelineStep

Then register the new step in the pipeline settings:

snippet:AddPipelineStep


## Replace an existing step

To replace the implementation of an existing step, you can replace it with your custom behavior:

snippet:ReplacePipelineStep

Note: You can also register your steps from a [Feature](features.md)


## Stages

The following lists describe some of the common stages which you can build your own behaviors for. Each stage has a context associated with it (which is used by when implementing your custom behavior).


### Incoming Pipeline Stages
* Physical message processing: Behaviors on this stage have access the raw message body before it is deserialized. This stage provides `IIncomingPhysicalMessageContext` to it's behaviors.
* Logical message processing: This stage provides information about the received message type and it's deserialized instance. It provides `IIncomingLogicalMessageContext` to it's behaviors.
* Handler invocation: Each received message can be handled by multiple handlers. This stage will be executed once for every associated handler and provides `IInvokeHandlerContext` to the behaviors.

### Outgoing Pipeline Stages
* Operation specific processing: There is a dedicated stage for each bus operation (e.g. Send, Publish, Subscribe, ...). Behaviors can use one of the following contexts: `IOutgoingSendContext`, `IOutgoingPublishContext`, `IOutgoingReplyContext`, `ISubscribeContext`, `IUnsubscribeContext`.
* Logical message processing: Behaviors on this stage have access to the message which should be sent. Use `IOutgoingLogicalMessageContext` in your behavior to enlist in this stage.
* Physical message processing: Enables you to access the serialized message. This stage provides `IOutgoingPhysicalMessageContext` to it's behaviors.


NOTE: As in version 5, you can still configure steps by ordering them using `WellKnownSteps`. We recommend to not rely on certain steps but to choose the appropriate stage instead.


## Sharing data between behaviors

Sometimes a parent behavior might need to pass some information to a child behavior and vice versa. The `context` parameter of a behavior's Invoke method facilitates  passing data between behaviors. The context is very similar to a shared dictionary which allows adding and retrieving information from different behaviors.

snippet:SharingBehaviorData

Note that the context respects the stage hierarchy and only allows adding new entries in the scope of the current context. A child behavior (later in the pipeline chain) can read and even modify entries set by a parent behavior (earlier in the pipeline chain) but entries added by the child cannot be accessed from the parent.
