When using RavenDB in an environment where you are relying also on distributed transactions it can happen that a commit operation fails with the following error:

> "A resource manager with the same identifier is already registered with the specified transaction coordinator"

The above is generally due to multiple RavenDB `IDocumentStore` instances that, when running on the same machine, attempt to enlist in the same transaction with matching resource manager identifiers.

When using NServiceBus with the RavenDB persistence a constant and deterministic ResourceManagerId is automatically generated for each endpoint. When configuring an endpoint with a user instantiated `IDocumentStore`, ensure that it gets a unique resource manager ID not used by any other endpoint on the same machine.

It is possible to configure RavenDB to use a different resource manager ID in two ways:

* using the `connection string` adding a `ResourceManagerId` token as in the following sample: 

```xml
<add name="NServiceBus/Persistence"
          connectionString="Url=http://localhost:8080;ResourceManagerId=d5723e19-92ad-4531-adad-8611e6e05c8a" />
```

* At runtime when creating the `DocumentStore` instance, for example when you need to inject your own document store as in the following sample:

NOTE: Be sure that the resource manager ID is constant across process restarts otherwise it will be impossible for the instance to re-enlist in an existing distributed transaction in case of a crash.
