## External shared store at initialization

To use an external `DocumentStore`, but defer its creation until NServiceBus initializes, a `Func<ReadOnlySettings, IDocumentStore>` can be provided which will allow the `DocumentStore` to be created with access to the `ReadOnlySettings`. This gives the ability to configure the document store based on conventions derived from endpoint data present in the settings object. For example, the `DocumentStore` instance can be configured to use the [Endpoint Name](/nservicebus/endpoints/specify-endpoint-name.md) as its database name by accessing `readOnlySettings.EndpointName()`.

## External store at initialization for a specific persister

A `DocumentStore` can be created at initialization time, with access to endpoint settings found in `ReadOnlySettings`, for usage in a specific persister (e.g. timeouts) by using the following code:
