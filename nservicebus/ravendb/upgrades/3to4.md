As part of this update [NServiceBus Version 6](/nservicebus/upgrades/5to6.md) will be required.


## Namespace change

The `RavenDBPersistence` has moved from `NServiceBus.Persistence` namespace to `NServiceBus`. There is no need to have an extra using statement if the NServiceBus.RavenDB NuGet package is installed. 


## Configuring a shared session

Configuring a shared raven session now requires a `Func<IAsyncDocumentSession>` ([IAsyncDocumentSession](http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=IAsyncDocumentSession)) instead of a `Func<IDocumentSession>` (IDocumentSession)[http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=IDocumentSession].

## ISessionProvider is obsolete

In Version 3 of NServiceBus.RavenDB an `ISessionProvider` was available for dependency injection. The new method of accessing the raven session is the `SynchronizedStorageSession`.

### Session is available regardless of features enabled

In Version 3, the `RavenStorageSession` was only registered if at least one out of [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) and [Sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/) were enabled. There are possible use cases for using the NServiceBus wrapped RavenDB session so the prerequisites have been removed.
