## IConfigureThisEndpoint changes

## IWantToRunWhenEndpointStartsAndStops 

An interface called [`IWantToRunWhenEndpointStartsAndStops`](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/) has been added. This interface replaces the [`IWantToRunWhenBusStartsAndStops`](/nservicebus/lifecycle/endpointstartandstop.md) in the NServiceBus core.

WARNING: If an `EndpointConfig.cs` file already exists in the project, be careful to not overwrite it when upgrading the `NServiceBus.Host` package. If Visual Studio detects a conflict, it will ask whether the file should be overwritten. To keep the old configuration, choose `No`.
