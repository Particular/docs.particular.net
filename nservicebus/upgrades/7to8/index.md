NOTE: This is a working document; there is currently no timeline for the release of NServiceBus version 8.0.

## Transport configuration

NServiceBus version 8 comes with a new transport configuration API. Instead of the generic-based `UseTransport<TTransport>` method, create an instance of the transport's configuration class and pass it to the the `UseTransport` method. For example, instead of:

```csharp
var transport = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport<MyTransport>();

transport.Transactions(TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly);
var routing = t.Routing();
routing.RouteToEndpoint(typeof(MyMessage), "DestinationEndpoint");
```

use:

```csharp
var transport = new MyTransport{
    TransportTransactionMode = TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly
};

var routing = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport(transport);
routing.RouteToEndpoint(typeof(MyMessage), "DestinationEndpoint");
```

See the [transport upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/transport.md) for further details.

Note: The existing API surface is supported for NServiceBus version 8 via a [shim API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)) to ease migration to the new version. However, it is recommended to switch to the new transport configuration API to prepare for future upgrades of NServiceBus.

## Dependency injection

NServiceBus no longer provides adapters for external dependency injection containers. Instead, NServiceBus version 8 directly provides the ability to use any container that conforms to the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` container abstraction. Visit the dedicated [dependency injection changes](/nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/dependency-injection.md) section of the upgrade guide for further information.


## Support for external logging providers

Support for external logging providers is no longer provided by NServiceBus adapters for each logging framework. Instead, the [`NServiceBus.Extensions.Logging` package](/nservicebus/logging/extensions-logging.md) provides the ability to use any logging provider that conforms to the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` abstraction.

The following provider packages will no longer be provided:

* [Common.Logging](/nservicebus/logging/common-logging.md)
* [Log4net](/nservicebus/logging/log4net.md)
* [NLog](/nservicebus/logging/nlog.md)

## CancellationToken support

NServiceBus version 8 supports cooperative cancellation using `CancellationToken`.

### Non-message-handling contexts

Methods on extension points are updated to include a mandatory `CancellationToken` parameter. This includes abstract classes and interfaces needed to implement a message transport or persistence libary, as well as other extension points like `IDataBus`, `FeatureStartupTask`, `INeedToInstallSomething`. Implementors can be updated by adding the `CancellationToken` parameter to the end of the method signature.

Methods used outside the message processing pipeline now include an optional `CancellationToken` parameter, including methods for starting and stopping endpoints, and methods to Send/Publish messages from outside a message processing pipeline, such as from within a web application.

It is recommended to forward a `CancellationToken` within a method to any method that accepts one. For example, within a web application controller:

```csharp
public class TestController
{
    private IMessageSession session;

    public TestController(IMessageSession session)
    {
        this.session = session;
    }

    [HttpGet("/test")]
    public async Task<string> Get(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Forward the cancellation token to methods that accept one
        await Task.Delay(10_000, cancellationToken);

        return "Finished 10s delay";
    }
}
```

[Enabling .NET source code analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/overview) (enabled by default in projects targeting .NET 5 or above) is also recommended so that [CA2016: Forward the CancellationToken parameter to methods that take one](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2016) can identify locations where the cancellation token should be forwarded. This rule is presesented as an informational message only, but the [analyzer severity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers#configure-severity-levels) can be upgraded to a warning using an [.editorconfig file](https://editorconfig.org/):

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2016.severity = warning
```

### Message handlers and pipeline

Inside a message handler, a cancellation token from the incoming message processing pipeline is available on the `IMessageHandlerContext` as the property `context.CancellationToken`. The cancellation token was added to the context parameter to avoid making a breaking change to `IHandleMessages` affecting all message handlers and sagas.

Similarly, [pipeline behaviors](/nservicebus/pipeline/manipulate-with-behaviors.md) also contain a `CancellationToken` property on their respective `context` parameters.

Methods on `IMessageHandlerContext` such as `Send()` and `Publish()` do not accept a cancellation token, as the token from the incoming message pipeline will be routed to the outgoing operations transparently.

It is recommended to forward the `context.CancellationToken` to any other method that accepts one. A new analyzer identifies locations where the token with a build warning, for example:

```csharp
public class SampleHandler : IHandleMessages<TestMessage>
{
    public async Task Handle(TestMessage message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
    {
        // Analyzer Warning NSB0002: Forward `context.CancellationToken` to the `Delay` method.
        await Task.Delay(10_000);
    }
}
```

The analyzer also offers a code fix that will update the code to forward the token using the "light bulb" menu. ( <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> )

If cancellation is not a major concern, the [analyzer severity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers#configure-severity-levels) can be downgraded using an [.editorconfig file](https://editorconfig.org/):

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.NSB0002.severity = suggestion
```

## New gateway persistence API

The NServiceBus gateway has been moved to a separate `NServiceBus.Gateway` package and all gateway public APIs in NServiceBus are obsolete and will produce the following warning:

> Gateway persistence has been moved to the NServiceBus.Gateway dedicated package. Will be treated as an error from version 8.0.0. Will be removed in version 9.0.0.

### How to upgrade

- Install the desired gateway persistence package. Supported packages are:
  - [NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql)
  - [NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB)
- Configure the gateway API by invoking the `endpointConfiguration.Gateway(...)` method, passing as an argument the selected storage configuration instance:
  - [Documentation for NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql](/nservicebus/gateway/sql/)
  - [Documentation for NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB](/nservicebus/gateway/ravendb/)


## Error notification events

In NServiceBus version 7.2, error notification events for `MessageSentToErrorQueue`, `MessageHasFailedAnImmediateRetryAttempt`, and `MessageHasBeenSentToDelayedRetries` using .NET events were deprecated in favor of `Task`-based callbacks. In NServiceBus version 8 and above, the event-based notifications will throw an error.

Error notifications can be set with the `Task`-based callbacks through the recoverability settings:

snippet: SubscribeToErrorsNotifications-UpgradeGuide


## Disabling subscriptions

In previous versions, users sometimes disabled the `MessageDrivenSubscriptions` feature to remove the need for a subscription storage on endpoints that do not publish events, which could cause other unintended consequences.

While NServiceBus still supports message-driven subscriptions for transports that do not have native publish/subscribe capabilities, the `MessageDrivenSubscriptions` feature itself has been deprecated.

To disable publishing on an endpoint, the declarative API should be used instead:

snippet: DisablePublishing-UpgradeGuide


## Change to license file locations

 NServiceBus version 8 will no longer attempt to load the license file from the `appSettings` section of an app.config or web.config file, in order to create better alignment between .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core.

In NServiceBus version 7 and below, the license path could be loaded from the `NServiceBus/LicensePath` app setting, or the license text itself could be loaded from the `NServiceBus/License` app setting.

Starting in NServiceBus version 8, one of the [other methods of providing a license](/nservicebus/licensing/?version=core_8) must be used.


## Support for message forwarding

NServiceBus no longer natively supports forwarding a copy of every message processed by an endpoint. Instead, create a custom behavior to forward a copy of every procesed message as described in [this sample](/samples/routing/message-forwarding).


## NServiceBus Host

The `NServiceBus.Host` package is deprecated. See the [NServiceBus Host upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/host-7to8.md) for details and alternatives.


## NServiceBus Azure Host

The `NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure` and `NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure.HostProcess` are deprecated.See the [NServiceBus Azure Host upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/acs-host-7to8.md) for details and alternatives.

## DateTimeOffset instead of DateTime

Usage of `DateTime` can result in numerous issues caused by misalignment of timezone offsets, which can lead to time calculation errors. Although a `DateTime.Kind` property exists, it is often ignored during DateTime math and it is up to the user to ensure values are aligned in their offset. The `DateTimeOffset` type fixes this. It does not contain any timezone information, only an offset, which is sufficient to get the time calculations right. 

[> These uses for DateTimeOffset values are much more common than those for DateTime values. As a result, DateTimeOffset should be considered the default date and time type for application development."](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/datetime/choosing-between-datetime)

In NServiceBus version 8, all APIs have been migrated from `DateTime` to `DateTimeOffset`.

## NServiceBus Scheduler

In NServiceBus version 8, the Scheduler API has been deprecated in favor of options like [sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/) and production-grade schedulers such as Hangfire, Quartz, and FluentScheduler.

It is recommended to create a .NET Timer with the same interval as the scheduled task and use `IMessageSession.SendLocal` to send a message to process. Using message processing has the benefit of using recoverability and uses a transactional context. If these benefits are not needed then do not send a message at all and directly invoke logic from the timer.

INFO: The behavior in NServiceBus version 7 is to **not** retry the task on failures, so be sure to wrap the business logic in a `try-catch` statement to get the same behavior in NServicebus version 8.

See the [scheduling with .NET Timers sample](/samples/scheduling/timer) for more details.

## Meaningful exceptions when stopped

NServiceBus version 8 throws an `InvalidOperationException` when invoking message opererations on `IMessageSession` when the endpoint instance is stopping or stopped to indicate that the instance can no longer be used.

## Non-durable messaging

Support for non-durable messaging has been moved to the transports that can support it, which as of November 2020 is only the RabbitMQ transport. When using another transport, use of `[Express]` or message conventions to request non-durable delivery can safely be removed.

RabbitMQ user should use the new [`options.UseNonPersistentDeliveryMode()` API provided by `NServiceBus.RabbitMQ` Version 7](/transports/rabbitmq/#controlling-delivery-mode)

## Timeout manager removed

With all currently-supported transports now supporting native delayed delivery, the [timeout manager](/nservicebus/messaging/timeout-manager.md) is no longer needed. Any calls to `EndpointConfiguration.TimeoutManager()` and `EndpointConfiguration.UseExternalTimeoutManager()` can safely be removed.

### Data migration

Using a transport that previously relied on the timeout manager may require a migration of existing timeouts. Use the [timeouts migration tool](/nservicebus/tools/migrate-to-native-delivery.md) to detect and migrate timeouts as needed.

The following transports might need migration:

* RabbitMQ
* Azure Storage Queues
* SQL Transport
* SQS

### IManageUnitOfWork 

`IManageUnitOfWork` interface is no longer recommended. The unit of work pattern is more straightforward to implement in a pipeline behavior, where the using keyword and try/catch blocks can be used. 

[Custom unit of work sample](/samples/pipeline/unit-of-work/) is an example of the the recommended approach.

## Outbox configuration

NServiceBus version 8 requires the transport transaction mode to be set explicitly to `ReceiveOnly` when using the [outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) feature:

```csharp
var transport = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport<MyTransport>();

transport.TransportTransactionMode = TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly;

endpointConfiguration.EnableOutbox();
```

### AbortReceiveOperation

`ITransportReceiveContext.AbortReceiveOperation` operation is no longer supported
