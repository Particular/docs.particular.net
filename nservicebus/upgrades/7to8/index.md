This document focuses on changes that are affecting general endpoint configuration and message handlers. For more upgrade guides, also see the following:

* [Changes for downstream implementations like custom/community transports, persistence, message serializers](implementations.md)
* [Changes related to the pipeline](pipeline.md)
* [Changes to framework requirements](/nservicebus/operations/dotnet-framework-version-requirements.md)

## Removed support for .NET Standard

.NET Standard support was removed in NServiceBus version 8. Instead, NServiceBus targets .NET Framework 4.5.2 and .NET Core 3.1 directly (read more about the [supported frameworks and platforms](/nservicebus/upgrades/supported-platforms.md)). While this should have no direct impact on endpoint executables, shared message contract assemblies that target .NET Standard might need to be adjusted. Refer to the [updating message contracts](message-contracts.md) page for more details.

## Transport configuration

NServiceBus version 8 comes with a new transport configuration API. Instead of the generic-based `UseTransport<TTransport>` method, create an instance of the transport's configuration class and pass it to the the `UseTransport` method. For example, instead of:

```csharp
var transport = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport<MyTransport>();
transport.Transactions(TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly);

var routing = t.Routing();
routing.RouteToEndpoint(typeof(MyMessage), "DestinationEndpoint");
```

Use:

```csharp
var transport = new MyTransport{
    TransportTransactionMode = TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly
};

var routing = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport(transport);
routing.RouteToEndpoint(typeof(MyMessage), "DestinationEndpoint");
```

See the [transport upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/transport.md) for further details.

## Dependency injection

NServiceBus no longer provides adapters for external dependency injection containers. Instead, NServiceBus version 8 directly provides the ability to use any container that conforms to the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` container abstraction. Visit the dedicated [dependency injection changes](/nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/dependency-injection.md) section of the upgrade guide for further information.

## Support for external logging providers

Support for external logging providers is no longer provided by NServiceBus adapters for each logging framework. Instead, the [`NServiceBus.Extensions.Logging` package](/nservicebus/logging/extensions-logging.md) provides the ability to use any logging provider that conforms to the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` abstraction.

The following provider packages will no longer be provided:

* [Common.Logging](/nservicebus/logging/common-logging.md)
* [Log4net](/nservicebus/logging/log4net.md)
* [NLog](/nservicebus/logging/nlog.md)

## CancellationToken support

NServiceBus version 8 supports [cooperative cancellation](/nservicebus/hosting/cooperative-cancellation.md) using `CancellationToken` parameters. Where appropriate, optional `CancellationToken` parameters have been added to public methods. This includes the abstract classes and interfaces required to implement a message transport or persistence library, and other extension points like `IDataBus`, `FeatureStartupTask`, and `INeedToInstallSomething`. Implementers can be updated by adding an optional `CancellationToken` parameter to the end of method signatures. The change also includes callbacks that customize the behavior of NServiceBus:

* when a [critical error](/nservicebus/hosting/critical-errors.md) is encountered
* when a message is retried
* when a message is moved to the error queue
* when a message is processed

## Shutdown behavior

In all versions of NServiceBus, `endpoint.Stop()` immediately stops receiving new messages but waits for a period of time for currently running message handlers to complete.

In NServiceBus version 7 and below, the MSMQ, Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, Azure Storage Queues, and SQL transports allow handlers up to 30 seconds to complete before forcing an endpoint shutdown. In NServiceBus version 8, all transports block shutdown until all handlers complete or the [transport transaction](/transports/transactions.md) times out.

The `CancellationToken` available on the `IMessageHandlerContext` in NServiceBus version 8 is triggered when the host forces shutdown. For example, by default, the .NET Generic Host signals the cancellation token after 5 seconds.

However, if handlers do not observe the cancellation token, they will be allowed to complete before the endpoints shuts down. This means that if, for example, a handler calls `Task.Delay(TimeSpan.Infinite)`, the endpoint will never shut down.

Therefore, it is recommended that all message handlers observe the cancellation token to enable forced shutdown when required.

## New gateway persistence API

The NServiceBus gateway has been moved to a separate `NServiceBus.Gateway` package and all gateway public APIs in NServiceBus are obsolete and will produce the following warning:

> Gateway persistence has been moved to the NServiceBus.Gateway dedicated package. Will be treated as an error from version 8.0.0. Will be removed in version 9.0.0.

### How to upgrade

* Install the desired gateway persistence package. Supported packages are:
  * [NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql)
  * [NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB)
* Configure the gateway API by invoking the `endpointConfiguration.Gateway(...)` method, passing as an argument the selected storage configuration instance:
  * [Documentation for NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql](/nservicebus/gateway/sql/)
  * [Documentation for NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB](/nservicebus/gateway/ravendb/)

## Error notification events

In NServiceBus version 7.2, error notification events for `MessageSentToErrorQueue`, `MessageHasFailedAnImmediateRetryAttempt`, and `MessageHasBeenSentToDelayedRetries` using .NET events were deprecated in favor of `Task`-based callbacks. In NServiceBus version 8 and above, the event-based notifications will throw an error.

Error notifications can be set with the `Task`-based callbacks through the recoverability settings:

snippet: SubscribeToErrorsNotifications-UpgradeGuide

## Disabling subscriptions

In previous versions, users sometimes disabled the `MessageDrivenSubscriptions` feature to remove the need for a subscription storage on endpoints that do not publish events, which could cause other unintended consequences.

While NServiceBus still supports message-driven subscriptions for transports that do not have native publish/subscribe capabilities, the `MessageDrivenSubscriptions` feature itself has been deprecated.

To disable publishing on an endpoint, the declarative API should be used instead:

snippet: DisablePublishing-UpgradeGuide

## Change to license file locations

 NServiceBus version 8 will no longer attempt to load the license file from the `appSettings` section of an app.config or web.config file, in order to create better alignment between .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Core.

In NServiceBus version 7 and below, the license path could be loaded from the `NServiceBus/LicensePath` app setting, or the license text itself could be loaded from the `NServiceBus/License` app setting.

Starting in NServiceBus version 8, one of the [other methods of providing a license](/nservicebus/licensing/?version=core_8) must be used.

## Support for message forwarding

NServiceBus no longer natively supports forwarding a copy of every message processed by an endpoint. Instead, create a custom behavior to forward a copy of every processed message as described in [message forwarding sample](/samples/routing/message-forwarding).

## NServiceBus Host

The `NServiceBus.Host` package is deprecated. See the [NServiceBus Host upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/host-7to8.md) for details and alternatives.

## NServiceBus Azure Host

The `NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure` and `NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure.HostProcess` are deprecated.See the [NServiceBus Azure Host upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/acs-host-7to8.md) for details and alternatives.

## Overriding the host machine name

`RuntimeEnvironment.MachineNameAction` is deprecated. The host machine name of an endpoint instance may be overridden using:

```csharp
endpointConfiguration.UniquelyIdentifyRunningInstance()
    .UsingHostName("NewMachineName");`
```

## DateTimeOffset instead of DateTime

Usage of `DateTime` can result in numerous issues caused by misalignment of time zone offsets, which can lead to time calculation errors. Although a `DateTime.Kind` property exists, it is often ignored during DateTime math and it is up to the user to ensure values are aligned in their offset. The `DateTimeOffset` type fixes this. It does not contain any time zone information, only an offset, which is sufficient to get the time calculations right.

[> These uses for DateTimeOffset values are much more common than those for DateTime values. As a result, DateTimeOffset should be considered the default date and time type for application development."](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/datetime/choosing-between-datetime)

In NServiceBus version 8, all APIs have been migrated from `DateTime` to `DateTimeOffset`.

## NServiceBus Scheduler

In NServiceBus version 8, the Scheduler API has been deprecated in favor of options like [sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/) and production-grade schedulers such as Hangfire, Quartz, and FluentScheduler.

It is recommended to create a .NET Timer with the same interval as the scheduled task and use `IMessageSession.SendLocal` to send a message to process. Using message processing has the benefit of using recoverability and uses a transactional context. If these benefits are not needed then do not send a message at all and directly invoke logic from the timer.

INFO: The behavior in NServiceBus version 7 is to **not** retry the task on failures, so be sure to wrap the business logic in a `try-catch` statement to get the same behavior in NServiceBus version 8.

See the [scheduling with .NET Timers sample](/samples/scheduling/timer) for more details.

## Meaningful exceptions when stopped

NServiceBus version 8 throws an `InvalidOperationException` when invoking message operations on `IMessageSession` when the endpoint instance is stopping or stopped to indicate that the instance can no longer be used.

## Non-durable messaging

Support for non-durable messaging has been moved to the transports that can support it, which as of November 2020 is only the RabbitMQ transport. When using another transport, use of `[Express]` or message conventions to request non-durable delivery can safely be removed.

RabbitMQ user should use the new [`options.UseNonPersistentDeliveryMode()` API provided by `NServiceBus.RabbitMQ` Version 7](/transports/rabbitmq/#controlling-delivery-mode)

## Non-durable persistence

Support for non-durable persistence (previously known as `InMemoryPersistence`) has been removed from the `NServiceBus` package to a separate `NServiceBus.Persistence.NonDurable` package. To continue using it, add a reference to the new package and update the configuration code.

```csharp
endpointConfiguration.UsePersistence<NonDurablePersistence>();
```

## Timeout manager removed

With all currently-supported transports now supporting native delayed delivery, the [timeout manager](/nservicebus/messaging/timeout-manager.md) is no longer needed. Any calls to `EndpointConfiguration.TimeoutManager()` and `EndpointConfiguration.UseExternalTimeoutManager()` can safely be removed.

### Data migration

Using a transport that previously relied on the timeout manager may require a migration of existing timeouts. Use the [timeouts migration tool](/nservicebus/tools/migrate-to-native-delivery.md) to detect and migrate timeouts as needed.

The following transports might need migration:

* RabbitMQ
* Azure Storage Queues
* SQL Transport
* SQS
* MSMQ

## Outbox configuration

NServiceBus version 8 requires the transport transaction mode to be set explicitly to `ReceiveOnly` when using the [outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) feature:

```csharp
var transport = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport<MyTransport>();

transport.TransportTransactionMode = TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly;

endpointConfiguration.EnableOutbox();
```

## AbortReceiveOperation

`ITransportReceiveContext.AbortReceiveOperation` has been deprecated in favor of throwing an [`OperationCanceledException`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.operationcanceledexception). This will preserve the NServiceBus version 7 behavior of immediately retrying the message without invoking [recoverability](/nservicebus/recoverability).

## Renamed extension method types

The following static extension method types were renamed:

| Old name                       | New name                      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `IEndpointInstanceExtensions`  | `EndpointInstanceExtensions`  |
| `IMessageProcessingExtensions` | `MessageProcessingExtensions` |
| `IMessageSessionExtensions`    | `MessageSessionExtensions`    |
| `IPipelineContextExtensions`   | `PipelineContextExtensions`   |

All references to the old types must be changed to the new types, although usually these types are not referenced, since they only contain extension methods.

## Gateway in-memory deduplication

The `InMemoryDeduplicationConfiguration` type within the NServiceBus.Gateway package has been renamed to `NonDurableDeduplicationConfiguration`.

## Dependency on System.Memory package for .NET Framework

Memory allocations for incoming and outgoing messages bodies are reduced by using the low allocation memory types via the System.Memory namespace. These type are available on .NET Framework via the **System.Memory** package. The NServiceBus build that targets .NET Framework has this dependency added.

## Endpoint addresses

In NServiceBus version 7 and earlier, the local transport-specific queue addresses are accessible via the `settings.LocalAddress()` and `settings.InstanceSpecificQueue()` settings extension methods. In version 8, these extension methods have been marked as obsolete in favour of the API described in this section.

### Logical endpoint address

Since the endpoint addresses are translated to the transport-specific later during endpoint startup, addresses are defined using a transport-agnostic `QueueAddress` type. The addresses can be accessed via the `FeatureConfigurationContext`, for example:

```csharp
class MyFeature : Feature
{
    protected override void Setup(FeatureConfigurationContext context)
    {
        // instead of context.Settings.LocalAddress();
        var localAddress = context.LocalQueueAddress();

        // instead of context.Settings.InstanceSpecificQueue();
        var instanceSpecificAddress = context.InstanceSpecificQueueAddress();
    }
}
```

A `QueueAddress` can be translated to a transport-specific address at runtime using `ITransportAddressResolver` if needed. The transport-specific receiving queue address can be directly accessed via `ReceiveAddresses`. See the next section for more information.

### Endpoint receive addresses

Instead of using the `settings.LocalAddress()` and `settings.InstanceSpecificQueue()` methods to get the endpoint's local receive addresses, inject the `ReceiveAddresses` type to access the endpoint receive addresses.

```csharp
class StartupTask : FeatureStartupTask
{
    static readonly ILog log = LogManager.GetLogger<StartupTask>();

    readonly ReceiveAddresses receiveAddresses;

    public StartupTask(ReceiveAddresses receiveAddresses)
    {
        this.receiveAddresses = receiveAddresses;
    }

    protected override Task OnStart(IMessageSession session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // equivalent to settings.LocalAddress()
        log.Info($"Starting endpoint, listening on {receiveAddresses.MainReceiveAddress}");

        if (receiveAddresses.InstanceReceiveAddress != null)
        {
            // equivalent to settings.InstanceSpecificQueue())
            log.Info($"Starting endpoint, listening on {receiveAddresses.InstanceReceiveAddress}");
        }
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    protected override Task OnStop(IMessageSession session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) => Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

### Dynamic address translation

Instead of using `settings.Get<TransportDefinition>().ToTransportAddress(myAddress)` to translate `QueueAddress` to a transport-specific address, inject the `ITransportAddressResolver` type to access the address translation mechanism at runtime.

```csharp
public class MyHandler : IHandleMessages<MyMessage>
{
    ITransportAddressResolver addressResolver;

    public MyHandler(ITransportAddressResolver addressResolver)
    {
        this.addressResolver = addressResolver;
    }

    public Task Handle(MyMessage message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
    {
        var destination = addressResolver.ToTransportAddress(new QueueAddress("Sales"));
        var sendOptions = new SendOptions();
        sendOptions.SetDestination(destination);
        return context.Send(new SomeMessage(), sendOptions);
    }
}
```

## Implicit global using directives

NServiceBus 8 supports the [implicit global using directives](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#implicit-using-directives) feature introduced in the .NET 6 SDK. When `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>` has been set in the project file, all files in the project will have an implicit `using NServiceBus;` added to them. In the event that this introduces a conflict between two identically named types in referenced namespaces, the ambiguity will need to be resolved manually.

To disable the implicit adding of the `NServiceBus` namespace while still keeping `ImplicitUsings` enabled, add the following to the project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Using Remove="NServiceBus" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Analyzers and packages.config

The Roslyn analyzers included with NServiceBus 8 no longer provide support for projects that use a `packages.config` file. To receive the benefit of Roslyn analyzers such as the [warning on an unawaited Task](/nservicebus/operations/nservicebus-analyzer.md) or the [saga analyzers](/nservicebus/sagas/analyzers.md), a project file must use `PackageReference` elements.

## Saga analyzers

NServiceBus version 8 elevates several [saga-related Roslyn analyzers](/nservicebus/sagas/analyzers.md) introduced in NServiceBus version 7.7 from Warning to Error, which will prevent a successful build when using default analyzer settings. These diagnostics indicate a serious issue that should be fixed. However, all Roslyn analyzer diagnostics [can be suppressed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers) if necessary.

* **NSB0003 Non-mapping expression used in ConfigureHowToFindSaga method**: No other statements besides mapping expressions using the provided `mapper` argument are allowed.
* **NSB0006 Message that starts the saga does not have a message mapping**: Without a mapping expression, the correct saga data cannot be found for an incoming message. A code fix is available that will add a new mapping to the `ConfigureHowToFindSaga` method. If using a [custom saga finder](/nservicebus/sagas/saga-finding.md), the error can be suppressed.
* **NSB0007 Saga data property is not writeable**: Properties on saga data classes must have public setters so they can be loaded properly.
* **NSB0009 A saga cannot use the Id property for a Correlation ID**: The `Id` property is reserved for use by the saga. Because some saga storage options are case insensitive, the other casings `ID`, `id`, and `iD` are also not allowed.
* **NSB0015 Saga should not implement IHandleSagaNotFound**: The `IHandleSagaNotFound` extension point allows handling *any* message where saga data cannot be loaded. Implementing this interface on a saga gives the wrong impression that it only handles sagas not found for that saga, which is incorrect. Instead, implement the saga not found logic on a separate class.
