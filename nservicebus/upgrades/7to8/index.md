## New gateway persistence API

The NServiceBus Gateway has been moved to a separate `NServiceBus.Gateway` package and all Gateway public API in NServiceBus has been obsoleted with the following warning:

> Gateway persistence has been moved to the NServiceBus.Gateway dedicated package. Will be treated as an error from version 8.0.0. Will be removed in version 9.0.0.

### How to upgrade

- Install the desired gateway persistence package. Supported packages are:
  - [NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql)
  - [NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB)
- Configure the Gateway API by invoking the `endpointConfiguration.Gateway(â€¦)` method, passing as an argument the selected storage configuration instance:
  - [Documentation for NServiceBus.Gateway.Sql](/nservicebus/gateway/sql/)
  - [Documentation for NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB](/nservicebus/gateway/ravendb/)
