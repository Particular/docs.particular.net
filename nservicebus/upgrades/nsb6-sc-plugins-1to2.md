## Connecting to ServiceControl

Version 2 of the ServiceControl plugins changes the way that the plugins connect to ServiceControl. The plugins no longer derive a ServiceControl queue name from the Error/Audit queues. Additional configuration is required to specify the location of the ServiceControl queue. 


### Configuration File

The location of the ServiceControl queue can be specified once for all plugins in via an `appSetting` in the endpoint configuration file.

### Code

The location of the ServiceControl queue can be specified via plugin-specific extensions to the endpoint configuration.
