## [Forwarding Topology](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/topologies/) number of entities in bundle removed

In Versions 8 and above the API to configure bundle prefix and number of entities in a bundle has been removed:

snippet: 7to8-number-of-entities-bundle

The bundle is set to one entity. For existing endpoints running with multiple entities in a bundle, the transport automatically picks up previously configured entities. The default topic name for bundle is set to `bundle-1`.

See also [Azure Service Bus Transport Topologies](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/topologies/).


## BrokeredMessage conventions

API to specify how the `BrokeredMessage` body is stored and retrieved by overriding the default conventions is obsoleted and the following methods were deprecated:

snippet: asb-incoming-message-convention

snippet: asb-outgoing-message-convention
