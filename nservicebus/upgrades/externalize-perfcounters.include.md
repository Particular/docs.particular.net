The [Windows Performance Counters feature](/monitoring/metrics/performance-counters.md) is in the process of being removed from the NServiceBus NuGet package. It is now available as a separate NuGet package, [NServiceBus.Metrics.PerformanceCounters](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Metrics.PerformanceCounters/). The new package should be used to write to performance counters when using NServiceBus Versions 6.2 and above.

The Performance Counters APIs in the NServiceBus NuGet package have been marked as [obsolete with warning](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.obsoleteattribute.aspx) and can still be used by suppressing the [CS0618 warning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0618).
