The [Windows Performance Counters feature](/monitoring/metrics/performance-counters.md) has been removed from the NServiceBus NuGet package. It is now available as a separate NuGet package named [NServiceBus.Metrics.PerformanceCounters](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Metrics.PerformanceCounters/). The new package should be used to write to performance counters when using NServiceBus Versions 6.2 and above.
