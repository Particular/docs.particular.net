## Setting headers on outgoing messages

Headers are now set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options. `Bus.SetMessageHeader` is no longer available.

See also [Header Manipulation](/nservicebus/messaging/header-manipulation.md).


## Setting outgoing headers for the entire endpoint

NServiceBus allows setting headers that are applied to all outgoing messages for the entire endpoint. In Version 6 this can be done using:

snippet: 5to6header-static-endpoint


## Setting headers on the outgoing pipeline

Headers for outgoing messages can now be set using `context.Headers` on pipelines like shown below:

snippet: 5to6header-outgoing-behavior

Also note that headers can only be set on the outgoing pipeline.
