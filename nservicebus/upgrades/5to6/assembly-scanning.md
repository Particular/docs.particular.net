## Nested directories not scanned by default

The default behavior of version 6 is to not scan nested directories for assemblies. This behavior can be re-enabled using the [assembly scanning API](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md#assembly-files-nested-directories).


## Scanning uses an "exclude" approach

The API has been changed to an "exclude a list" approach. See [Assemblies to scan](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md#assemblies-to-scan) for more information.
