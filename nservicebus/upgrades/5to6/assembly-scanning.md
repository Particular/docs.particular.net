## Nested Directories

The default behavior of Version 6 is to not scan nested directories for assemblies. This behavior can re-enable using the [Assembly Scanning API](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md#nested-directories).


## Include moved to Exclude

The API has been changed to an "Exclude a list" approach. See [Assemblies to scan](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md#assemblies-to-scan) for more information.
