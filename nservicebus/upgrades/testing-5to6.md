NServiceBus.Testing requires NServiceBus version 6.

As part of upgrading to NServiceBus.Testing version 6, projects will also require an upgrade to [NServiceBus version 6](/nservicebus/upgrades/5to6/).


## New unit testing capabilities

NServiceBus.Testing version 6 provides an alternate way to write tests using a more traditional *Arrange Act Assert* pattern. This allows for easier extension and tooling integration. For more details on the new testing capabilities, see the [Unit Testing NServiceBus 6 Sample](/samples/unit-testing).


## Testing framework


### Removed Test.Initialize()

It is no longer necessary to call `Test.Initialize()` before executing a test. All calls to `Test.Initialize()` can be safely removed.


#### Unobtrusive message conventions

With the removal of `Test.Initialize()`, it is also no longer necessary to configure unobtrusive message conventions.


## Testing message handlers


### ExpectReturn method

Use `ExpectReply` instead of `ExpectReturn`.


### SendToSites methods

`ExpectSendToSites` and `ExpectNotSendToSites` methods have been removed from the testing framework. Handlers using the gateway can still be tested using the `ExpectSend` overload which provides the `SendOption`:

snippet: ExpectSendToSiteV6


## Testing sagas


### Using When

In NServiceBus version 6 and above, message handlers have an additional `IMessageHandlerContext` parameter. This context parameter must be provided when defining the method to invoke.

snippet: 5to6-usingWhen

A new overload has been added to simplify this:

snippet: 5to6-usingNewOverload

WARNING: It's important to pass the context provided by the delegate arguments to the handle method.


### Configuring a message ID

The message ID can be configured manually using the `ConfigureMessageHandler` option. See [Configuring the context](#configuring-the-context) section below for more details.


## Configuring the context

Both saga and handler tests contain a `ConfigureHandlerContext` method to enable custom configuration of the `IMessageHandlerContext` which is passed to the invoked handler methods.
