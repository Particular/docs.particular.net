## Update NServiceBus dependencies

All NServiceBus dependencies for an endpoint project are managed via NuGet. Open the Manage NuGet Packages window for the endpoint project, switch to the Updates tab and look for packages that start with NServiceBus. Update each one to the latest package.

Once packages have been updated the project will contain quite a few errors. This is expected as a lot of things have changed.
