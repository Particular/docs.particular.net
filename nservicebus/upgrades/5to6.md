## Move to .NET 4.5.1

In Version 6 the new minimum .net version for NServiceBus is .NET 4.5.1 

**This means consumers need to update all projects (that reference NServiceBus) to be .NET 4.5.1 before updating to NServiceBus V6. **

In the interest of "smaller changes are easier to verify" it is recommended that you do the update to .NET 4.5.1, and full migration to production, before updating to NServiceBus V6.

## Header management


### Setting headers on outgoing messages

Headers are now set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options. `Bus.SetMessageHeader` is no longer available.

Full documentation on how to manage headers can be found [here](/nservicebus/messaging/message-headers.md) 


### Setting outgoing headers for the entire endpoint

NServiceBus allows you to set headers that are applied to all outgoing messages for the entire endpoint. In version 6 you now do this using:

<!-- import header-static-endpoint -->


### Setting headers on the outgoing pipeline

Headers can now be set using `context.SetHeader` like show below

<!-- import header-outgoing-behavior -->

Also note that headers are "set" only on the outgoing pipeline.


## Using a custom correlation id

Custom [correlation Id's](/nservicebus/messaging/message-correlation.md) for outgoing messages should now be set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options instead of being passed into `bus.Send`


## Message mutators

The `IMessageMutator` and `IMutateTransportMessages` interfaces are no longer available. Instead you should just use the individual `IMutateOutgoingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingTransportMessages` and `IMutateOutgoingTransportMessages` as needed since they provide the same functionality.

### New context arguments

The signature for the mutators now pass context arguments that gives you access to relevant information on the message and also giving you ways to mutate the message. This context will give you access to the same functionality as previous versions so just update your code accordingly.

See [header management](/nservicebus/messaging/message-headers.md) for one example on how this might look. 


## Visual Studio PowerShell helpers removed  

In version 3 of NServiceBus a feature was added to the nuget package that allowed consumers to generate xml configurations sections using the PowerShell console in Visual Studio. For example `Add-NServiceBusAuditConfig ProjectName` would result in the following being added to the app.config.

```
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="AuditConfig" type="NServiceBus.Config.AuditConfig, NServiceBus.Core" />
  </configSections>
  <AuditConfig QueueName="audit" />
</configuration>
```

In Version 6 these helpers have been removed for several reasons.


### Not discoverable 

These helpers are no more discoverable than using documentation or samples. If you need to read documentation to discover the commandlet you can just as copy the documentation on how to configure it.


### Code based configuration

In Version 6 we are improving the code based configuration story. For example you can now configure both [Error](/nservicebus/errors/#configure-your-error-queue-using-code) and [Audit](/nservicebus/operations/auditing.md#configuring-auditing-using-code) queues via the code API. This approach is more versatile since you can now read you configuration from any location at runtime.


### They are a crutch that enabled complex configuration

Configuration should be easy to apply to your code and easy to manipulate by hand. Unfortunately the configuration helpers enabled more complex xml configuration by allowing people to take the stance of "it is OK this is complex to configure since the xml can be generated". This is not a scenario we want to enable moving forward.


## Sagas

### Unique attribute no longer needed

NServiceBus will automatically make correlated saga properties unique without the need for a explicit `[Unique]` attribute to be used. You can safely remove the attribute from your saga data types.


## MSMQ ReturnToSourceQueue.exe

The MSMQ ReturnToSourceQueue.exe tool is now deprecated. The code for this tool has been moved to [ParticularLabs/MsmqReturnToSourceQueue](https://github.com/ParticularLabs/MsmqReturnToSourceQueue) repository. See the readme in that repository for full details.

## Message handler ordering
In Version 6 we simplified the message handler ordering APIs. Previously there were multiple ways to specify the handler ordering:

* Using a code only approach with `config.LoadMessageHandlers(First<H1>.Then<H2>().AndThen<H3>().AndThen<H4>())`
* By implementing `ISpecifyMessageHandlerOrdering` and either using `order.SpecifyFirst<H1>` or `order.Specify(First<H1>.Then<H2>())`

The unified approach can be accessed by either using `config.ExecuteTheseHandlersFirst(params Type[] handlerTypes)` or `config.ExecuteTheseHandlersFirst(IEnumerable<Type> handlerTypes)` on the `BusConfiguration` instance.

### With the configuration API

<!-- import HandlerOrderingWithCode -->

If you have been using `ISpecifyMessageHandlerOrdering` in a separate assembly scanned by NServiceBus we suggest to use `INeedInitialization`

#### Specifying one to run first

<!-- import HandlerOrderingWithFirst -->

#### Specifying multiple to run ordered

<!-- import HandlerOrderingWithMultiple -->

## Accessing the builder outside the NServiceBus infrastructure
When you wanted to use the `IBuilder` interface outside the infrastructure of NServiceBus it was possible to use a hack by casting the `IBus` interface to `UnicastBus` and then accessing the `Builder` property like this:

`var builder = ((UnicastBus)bus).Builder`

This is no longer supported. We advise you to use your container of choice directly without going over the `IBuilder` interface.
