## Move to .NET 4.5.1

In Version 6 the new minimum .NET version for NServiceBus is .NET 4.5.1.

**This means consumers need to update all projects (that reference NServiceBus) to be .NET 4.5.1 before updating to NServiceBus version 6. **

In the interest of "smaller changes are easier to verify" it is recommended that you do the update to .NET 4.5.1, and full migration to production, before updating to NServiceBus version 6.


## Header management


### Setting headers on outgoing messages

Headers are now set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options. `Bus.SetMessageHeader` is no longer available.

Full documentation on how to manage headers can be found [here](/nservicebus/messaging/header-manipulation.md).


### Setting outgoing headers for the entire endpoint

NServiceBus allows you to set headers that are applied to all outgoing messages for the entire endpoint. In version 6 you now do this using:

<!-- import 5to6header-static-endpoint -->


### Setting headers on the outgoing pipeline

Headers can now be set using `context.SetHeader` like show below

<!-- import 5to6header-outgoing-behavior -->

Also note that headers are "set" only on the outgoing pipeline.


## Using a custom correlation id

Custom [correlation Id's](/nservicebus/messaging/message-correlation.md) for outgoing messages should now be set using the new `Send`/`Reply` or `Publish` options instead of being passed into `bus.Send`


## Message mutators

The `IMessageMutator` and `IMutateTransportMessages` interfaces are no longer available. Instead you should just use the individual `IMutateOutgoingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingMessages`, `IMutateIncomingTransportMessages` and `IMutateOutgoingTransportMessages` as needed since they provide the same functionality.


### New context arguments

The signature for the mutators now pass context arguments that gives you access to relevant information on the message and also giving you ways to mutate the message. This context will give you access to the same functionality as previous versions so just update your code accordingly.

See [header manipulation](/nservicebus/messaging/header-manipulation.md) for one example on how this might look.


## Visual Studio PowerShell helpers removed  

In version 3 of NServiceBus a feature was added to the nuget package that allowed consumers to generate xml configurations sections using the PowerShell console in Visual Studio. For example `Add-NServiceBusAuditConfig ProjectName` would result in the following being added to the app.config.

```
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="AuditConfig" type="NServiceBus.Config.AuditConfig, NServiceBus.Core" />
  </configSections>
  <AuditConfig QueueName="audit" />
</configuration>
```

In Version 6 these helpers have been removed for several reasons.


### Discoverability

These helpers are no more discoverable than using documentation or samples. If you need to read documentation to discover the commandlet you can just as copy the documentation on how to configure it.


### Code based configuration

In Version 6 we are improving the code based configuration story. For example you can now configure both [Error](/nservicebus/errors/#configure-your-error-queue-using-code) and [Audit](/nservicebus/operations/auditing.md#configuring-auditing-using-code) queues via the code API. This approach is more versatile since you can now read you configuration from any location at runtime.


### They are a crutch that enabled complex configuration

Configuration should be easy to apply to your code and easy to manipulate by hand. Unfortunately the configuration helpers enabled more complex xml configuration by allowing people to take the stance of "it is OK this is complex to configure since the xml can be generated". This is not a scenario we want to enable moving forward.


## Timeouts


### Timeout storage

`IPersistTimeouts` has been split into two interfaces, `IPersistTimeouts` and `IQueryTimeouts`, to properly separate those storage concerns. Both must be implemented to have a fully functional timeout infrastructure. 

`IQueryTimeouts` implements the concern of polling for timeouts outside the context of a message pipeline. `IPersistTimeouts` implements the concern of storage and removal for timeouts which is executed inside the context of a pipeline. Depending on the design of the timeout persisters, those concerns can now be implemented independently. Furthermore, `IPersistTimeouts` introduced a new parameter `TimeoutPersistenceOptions `. This parameter allows access to the pipeline context. This enables timeout persisters to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution.


## Sagas


### Remove `NServiceBus.Saga` namespace

The `NServiceBus.Saga` namespace has been removed to stop it clashing with the `NServiceBus.Saga.Saga` class. For all commonly used APIs (eg the `Saga` class and `IContainSagaData ` interface) they have been moved into the `NServiceBus` namespace. Other more advanced APIs (eg the `IFinder` and `IHandleSagaNotFound` interfaces) have been moved into the `NServiceBus.Sagas` namespace. 

In most cases you will be able to simple replace `using NServiceBus.Saga` with `using NServiceBus`.


### Unique attribute no longer needed

NServiceBus will automatically make correlated saga properties unique without the need for a explicit `[Unique]` attribute to be used. You can safely remove the attribute from your saga data types.


### Saga persisters & finders

Saga persisters (`ISagaPersister`) and finders (`IFindSagas`) introduce a new parameter `SagaPersistenceOptions`. This parameter gives access to the saga metadata and pipeline context. This enables  persisters and finders to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution. For more information see [Sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/) and [Complex saga finding logic](/nservicebus/sagas/saga-finding.md).


## Outbox


### Outbox storage

`IOutboxStorage` introduced a new parameter `OutboxStorageOptions`. This parameter gives access to the pipeline context. This enables outbox storage methods to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution.


## Subscriptions


### Subscription storage

`ISubscriptionStorage` has been split into three interfaces, `ISubscriptionStorage`, `IInitializableSubscriptionStorage` and `IQuerySubscriptions`, to properly separate those storage concerns. `ISubscriptionStorage` and `IQuerySubscriptions` must be implemented to have a fully functional subscription infrastructure. `IInitializableSubscriptionStorage` is only necessary when the subscription storage needs to be initialized.

`IQuerySubscriptions` implements the concern of retrieving subscriptions outside the context of a message pipeline. `ISubscriptionStorage` implements the concern of storage and removal for subscriptions, which is executed inside the context of a pipeline. Depending on the design of the subscription storage, those concerns can now be implemented independently. Furthermore, `ISubscriptionStorage` introduced a new parameter `SubscriptionStorageOptions`. This parameter allows access to the pipeline context. This enables subscription storages to manipulate everything that exists in the context during message pipeline execution.


## MSMQ ReturnToSourceQueue.exe

The MSMQ ReturnToSourceQueue.exe tool is now deprecated. The code for this tool has been moved to [ParticularLabs/MsmqReturnToSourceQueue](https://github.com/ParticularLabs/MsmqReturnToSourceQueue) repository. See the readme in that repository for full details.


## Handling responses on the client side

We've separated the callback support from the NServiceBus core. This means that you now have to explicitly install our new [NServiceBus.Callbacks](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Callbacks/) to get access to callback support. In contrast to previous versions this API allows you to easily access the response message and is asynchronous by default.

The differences in the API are fully covered in [handling responses on the client side](/nservicebus/messaging/handling-responses-on-the-client-side.md).


## Message handler ordering

In Version 6 we simplified the message handler ordering APIs. Previously there were multiple ways to specify the handler ordering:

* Using a code only approach with `config.LoadMessageHandlers(First<H1>.Then<H2>().AndThen<H3>().AndThen<H4>())`
* By implementing `ISpecifyMessageHandlerOrdering` and either using `order.SpecifyFirst<H1>` or `order.Specify(First<H1>.Then<H2>())`

The unified approach can be accessed by either using `config.ExecuteTheseHandlersFirst(params Type[] handlerTypes)` or `config.ExecuteTheseHandlersFirst(IEnumerable<Type> handlerTypes)` on the `BusConfiguration` instance.

The full API can be seen in [Handler ordering](/nservicebus/handlers/handler-ordering.md).


## UnicastBus made internal

### Accessing the builder

When you wanted to use the `IBuilder` interface outside the infrastructure of NServiceBus it was possible to use a hack by casting the `IBus` interface to `UnicastBus` and then accessing the `Builder` property like this:

`var builder = ((UnicastBus)bus).Builder`

This is no longer supported. We advise to, instead of using `IBuilder` directly, use dependency injection via your container of choice.


### Accessing the current message context

Previously it was possible to access `IMessageContext` both over `UnicastBus` and the `IBus` interface. Accessing the current message context over `UnicastBus` is no longer supported. To get access to the current message context use `IBus.CurrentMessageContext`.


### Setting the host information

When you wanted to control the `HostInformation` you could do that over `UnicastBus.HostInformation`. We introduced a more explicit API to set the host identifier, see `busConfiguration.UniquelyIdentifyRunningInstance()`.


### Accessing ReadOnlySettings

`ReadOnlySettings` have been exposed on `UnicastBus.Settings`. The settings should only be accessed inside features, the pipeline and the start/stop infrastructure. Therefore accessing the settings over the `UnicastBus` is no longer supported.


## AutoSubscribe

The configuration option `DoNotRequireExplicitRouting()` has been obsoleted since transports with support for centralized pubsub will always auto subscribe all events without requiring explicit routing. Transports with message driven pubsub (like MSMQ, SqlServer and AzureStorageQueues) will not subscribe properly if there is no routing specified. If you used this option you can safely be removed it.


## Assembly scanning

See [Assembly Scanning API](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md) for more information.


### Nested Directories

NServiceBus version 6 is no longer scanning nested directories for assemblies. You can re-enable this behavior using the [Assembly Scanning API](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md#nested-directories).


### Include moved to Exclude

In version 6 the API has been changed to an "Exclude a list" approach. See [Assemblies to scan](/nservicebus/hosting/assembly-scanning.md#assemblies-to-scan) for more information.

<!-- import 5to6ScanningUpgrade -->

## Throttling

Throttling of message processing can no longer be adjusted at run time and will as of Version 6 require the endpoint to be restarted to take effect. You can read more about throttling [here](/nservicebus/operations/tuning.md).
## RepeatedFailuresOverTimeCircuitBreaker has been made internal

If your are using it just include [the source code](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/blob/5.2.5/src/NServiceBus.Core/CircuitBreakers/RepeatedFailuresOverTimeCircuitBreaker.cs) in your project.

## Transport seam

`IDispatchMessages` have been obsoleted and is replaced by `IPushMessages`. The interfaces are equivalent so if you're implementing your own transport you should be able to just implement the new interface.

### Corrupted messages

The core will now pass the error queue address to the transport to make it easier to handle corrupted messages. If corrupted message is detected the transport is expected to move the message to the specified error queue.
