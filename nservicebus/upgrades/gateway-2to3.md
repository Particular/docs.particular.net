## Code-first API

The gateway now allows full configuration via code. Use:

snippet: 2to3EnableGatewayAfter

to enable and configure sites and channels instead of:

snippet: 2to3EnableGatewayBefore

## Configuration

When running on .NET Core, configuration options in configuration files will **no longer be automatically detected**. Use the code-first API instead.

When running on the .NET Framework, settings in configuration files will still be used, however a warning will be logged indicating that it should be explicitly configured using the code-first API instead.
