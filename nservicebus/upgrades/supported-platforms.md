Supported frameworks can be used for production workloads with technical support available from Particular Software.

Support for individual components requires using [supported component versions](supported-versions.md) on a [supported version of .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy).

1. Not all packages support all frameworks and versions, due to framework restrictions, obsolete APIs, or transitive dependencies.
2. In this context, "supported" applies only to the framework runtime and doesn't necessarily indicate support for all languages features.
