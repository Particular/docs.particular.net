### Packages not supporting .NET Core

Some packages do not currently support .NET Core or running on non-Windows platforms:

* Transports
  * NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq - `System.Messaging` is not part of .NET Core, so MSMQ can't be supported on .NET Core.
* Containers
  * NServiceBus.Spring - Spring.Core does not support .NET Core.
* Hosts
  * These hosts are being deprecated and will not receive .NET Core support. They are replaced by the [ParticularTemplates package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ParticularTemplates) containing [templates for use with `dotnet new`](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md).
    * NServiceBus.Host
    * NServiceBus.Host32
    * NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure
    * NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure.HostProcess
* Other
  * NServiceBus.Wcf - Microsoft does not support the server aspects of WCF on .NET Core.
