NServiceBus is supported on the .NET Framework and .NET Core.

Note: If possible, packages will target [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) instead of individual platforms. While this means that packages might work with additional platforms, only the .NET Framework and .NET Core are officially supported by Particular Software.


### .NET Framework

NServiceBus is supported for applications targeting the .NET Framework on Windows. For the list of supported Windows versions, refer to [.NET Framework Versions and Dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies).

* **Windows**: All Windows versions according to [.NET Core 2.0 - Supported OS versions](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.0/2.0-supported-os.md) are fully supported.
