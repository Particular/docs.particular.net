NServiceBus is supported on the .NET Framework and .NET Core.

Note: If possible, packages will target [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) instead of individual platforms. While this means that packages might work with additional platforms, only the .NET Framework and .NET Core are officially supported by Particular Software.

| Target Framework | Version | Platform | Notes |
|------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:-----|
| .NET Framework | 4.5.2 or later | [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies) | Some packages may require a later version. |
| .NET 5 | 5.0.0 or later | [Windows / Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0-supported-os.md) | macOS is supported only for development purposes. |
| .NET Core | 2.1 (LTS) | [Windows / Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1-supported-os.md) | macOS is supported only for development purposes. |
| .NET Core | 3.1 (LTS) | [Windows / Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1-supported-os.md) | macOS is supported only for development purposes. |


### Packages not supporting .NET Core

Some packages do not currently support .NET Core or running on non-Windows platforms:

* Transports
  * NServiceBus.Transport.Msmq - `System.Messaging` is not part of .NET Core, so MSMQ can't be supported on .NET Core.
* Containers
  * NServiceBus.Spring - Spring.Core does not support .NET Core.
* Hosts
  * These hosts are being deprecated and will not receive .NET Core support. They are replaced by the [ParticularTemplates package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ParticularTemplates) containing [templates for use with `dotnet new`](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md).
    * NServiceBus.Host
    * NServiceBus.Host32
    * NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure
    * NServiceBus.Hosting.Azure.HostProcess
* Other
  * NServiceBus.Wcf - Microsoft does not support the server aspects of WCF on .NET Core.
