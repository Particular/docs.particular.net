As of .NET 7, the [`RijndaelManaged` class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.rijndaelmanaged) is obsolete and not recommended. The replacement class, [`AesManaged`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.aesmanaged) is backward-compatible with the old class in that messages encrypted with `RijdaelManaged` can be decrypted by `AesManaged` and vice versa.

## AesEncryptionService

`NServiceBus.Encryption.MessageProperty` version 3.1 includes the `AesEncryptionService` class that replaces the deprecated `RijndaelEncryptionService`.
