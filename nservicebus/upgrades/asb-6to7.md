## [Topology](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/topologies/) is mandatory

In Versions 7 and above the topology selection is mandatory:

snippet:topology-selection-upgrade-guide

The [`EndpointOrientedTopology`](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/topologies/#version-7-and-above-endpoint-oriented-topology)  is backward compatible with versions 6 and below of the transport. The [`ForwardingTopology`](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/topologies/#versions-7-and-above-forwarding-topology) is the recommended option for new projects.

When selecting `EndpointOrientedTopology`, it is also necessary to configure [publisher names](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/publisher-names-configuration.md), in order to ensure that subscribers are subscribed to the correct publisher:

For more details on topologies refer to the [Azure Service Bus Transport Topologies](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/topologies/) article.

## Sanitization

In Versions 6 and below sanitization was performed by default and the MD5 algorithm was used to truncate entity names. In Versions 7 and above, the sanitization has to be enabled and configured explicitly.

In order to maintain backward compatibility, [register a custom sanitization strategy](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/sanitization.md#automated-sanitization-backward-compatibility-with-versions-6-and-below).

In version 6.4.0 `NamingConventions` class was introduced to customize sanitization. The class is obsoleted. Instead, implement a [custom sanitization strategy](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/sanitization.md#sanitization).


## New Configuration API

In Versions 6 and below the transport was configured using an XML configuration section called `AzureServiceBusQueueConfig`. This section has been removed in favor of a more granular, code based configuration API.

The new configuration API is accessible through extension methods on the `UseTransport<AzureServiceBusTransport>()` extension point in the endpoint configuration. Refer to the [Full Configuration Page](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/configuration/full.md) for more details.

### Setting The Connection String

Setting the connection string can still be done using the `ConnectionString` extension method:

### Default value changes

The default values of the following settings have been changed:

 * `BatchSize`, which had a default value of 1000, is replaced by `PrefetchCount` with a default value of 200. 
 * `MaxDeliveryCount` is set to number of immediate retries + 1. For system queues the value has changed from 6 to 10.

For more details refer to the [ASB Batching](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/batching.md) and [ASB Retry behavior](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/retries.md) articles. 

### Setting Entity Property Values

The other configuration properties found on `AzureServiceBusQueueConfig` were related to the configuration of Azure Service Bus entities. Even though the name implied differently, these settings were not only applied to queues, but also to topics and subscriptions.

In the new configuration API the settings for queues, topics and subscriptions can be configured individually using the `Queues()`, `Topics()` and `Subscriptions()` extension points.

For example the lock duration on a queue can be configured using the `LockDuration` setting:

snippet:setting_queue_properties

and the size of the topics can be configured using the `MaxSizeInMegabytes` setting:

snippet:setting_topic_properties


## [Securing Credentials](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/securing-connection-strings.md)

include:asb-credential-warning

In order to enhance security and to avoid sharing sensitive information using `UseNamespaceNameInsteadOfConnectionString` feature follow the next steps:

 * Upgrade all endpoints to Version 7 or above. Previous versions of transport aren't able to understand namespace name instead of connection string.
 * After the above has been done and all endpoints deployed configure each endpoint switching on `UseNamespaceNameInsteadOfConnectionString` feature and re-deploy.


## BrokeredMessage conventions

In versions 6 and below, `BrokeredMessage` conventions were specified using `BrokeredMessageBodyConversion` class. In versions 7 and above, it has been replaced by [configuration API](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/brokered-message-creation.md).
