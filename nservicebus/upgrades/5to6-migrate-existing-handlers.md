title: Migrate existing handlers/sagas to Version 6
---

In previous versions of NServiceBus, a typical handler class looks like the below:

snippet:5to6-handler-migration-beginning

Implement the new `IHandleMessages` interface. Remove any code that is generated by the IDE or additional tools like Resharper and mark the new `Handle` method as `async` by adding the `async` keyword.

Rename the bus property or the bus constructor parameter to `context`.

snippet:5to6-handler-migration-step2

Inline or "cut-and-paste" the old `Handle` method code into the new asynchronous `Handle` method. When the code is compiled a compiler warning [`CS4014`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873131.aspx) will be shown indicating that there are asynchronous methods in the handler which are not awaited.

Fix the compiler warnings by introducing the `await` statement followed by `ConfigureAwait(false)` to each asynchronous method call.

INFO: Visual Studio Versions which support Roslyn have the capability to automatically fix those warnings with the `Ctrl+.` (depending on the keybindings) shortcut. It is even possible to fix it in the whole solution if desired.

After these steps start moving other code in the handler towards async if the code supports it when it is desired to fully leverage async/await. For example with Entity Framework instead of calling `SaveChanges` call `SaveChangesAsync` on the database context.
