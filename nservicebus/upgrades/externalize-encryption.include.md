The [Message Property Encryption feature](/nservicebus/security/property-encryption.md) has been moved from the NServiceBus package. It is now available as a separate NuGet package, [NServiceBus.Encryption.MessageProperty](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Encryption.MessageProperty/). The new package should be used to encrypt message properties when using NServiceBus Versions 6.2 and above.
