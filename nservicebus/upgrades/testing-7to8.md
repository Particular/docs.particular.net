## Fluent-style API is not supported

The fluent-style testing API is no longer supported. Tests should be written in an [Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/unit-test-basics#write-your-tests). Tests written this way will simply create the handler or saga to be tested, and call methods on them directly, passing in a testable message handler context that will capture outgoing operations that can be asserted on afterwards.

### Testing a handler

To test a handler, create it with any necessary dependencies, then call the `Handle` method directly. Pass in an instance of `TestableMessageHandlerContext` which will collect all outgoing operations. This context allows customization of metadata about the incoming message, including headers.

An example of the same test written in Arrange-Act-Assert style and Fluent style:

snippet: 7to8-testhandler

See [the handler unit testing documentation](/nservicebus/testing/#testing-a-handler) for more information.

### Testing a saga

To test a saga, create it with any necessary dependencies (including setting the `Data` property), then call the `Handle` method directly. Pass in an instance of `TestableMessageHandlerContext` which will collect all outgoing operations. This context allows customization of metadata about the incoming message, including headers.

Fluent-saga tests frequently will include multiple state changes. Arrange Act Assert (AAA) tests should test a single state change in isolation. The state of the saga can be manually configured before each test as part of the Arrange step.

This is an example showing two state changes. One to start the saga that triggers a timeout, sends a reply, publishes an event, and sends a message. The second state change happens when the timeout occurs, causing another event to be published, and the saga to be completed. These can be split into two tests (one for each state change) when using the Arrange-Act-Assert style.
