As part of this update [NServiceBus Version 6](/nservicebus/upgrades/5to6.md) will be required.


## Namespace changes

Namespaces for public types have been consolidated to make customizations more discoverable. The primary namespaces are `NServiceBus` for customization options that need to be discoverable, and `NServiceBus.Persistence.RavenDB` for advanced APIs. A single `using NServiceBus` directive should be sufficient to find all necessary options.

As part of this move, the following classes were moved to different namespaces:

 * `NServiceBus.Persistence.RavenDBPersistence` to the `NServiceBus` namespace.
 * `NServiceBus.RavenDB.Outbox.RavenDBOutboxExtensions` to the `NServiceBus` namespace.
 * `NServiceBus.RavenDB.ConnectionParameters` to the `NServiceBus.Persistence.RavenDB` namespace.


## Use of RavenDB Async API

NServiceBus now uses the asynchronous RavenDB API for all operations. If sharing the session between NServiceBus and handler code is required, then handler code will need to be adjusted to utilize the asynchronous RavenDB API as well.

Previously the API exposed an [`IDocumentSession`](http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=IDocumentSession), but now exposes [`IAsyncDocumentSession`](http://ravendb.net/docs/search/latest/csharp?searchTerm=IAsyncDocumentSession) instead, which contains the same operations but using a Task-based API.


## Configuring a shared session

Configuring a shared raven session now requires a `Func<IAsyncDocumentSession>` instead of a `Func<IDocumentSession>`.

## ISessionProvider is obsolete

In Version 3 of NServiceBus.RavenDB an `ISessionProvider` was available for dependency injection. The new method of accessing the raven session is the `SynchronizedStorageSession`.

### Session is available regardless of features enabled

In Version 3, the `RavenStorageSession` was only registered if at least one out of [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) and [Sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/) were enabled. There are possible use cases for using the NServiceBus wrapped RavenDB session so the prerequisites have been removed.
