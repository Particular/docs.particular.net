## Extensibility

`IForwardMessagesToSites`, `IRouteMessagesToEndpoints`, and `IRouteMessagesToSites` have been deprecated and are no longer available as extension points in the gateway. These have been replaced by [custom channel types](/nservicebus/gateway/multi-site-deployments.md#incoming-channels).


## Concurrency config

`NumberOfWorkerThreads` is now deprecated as a parameter for channels in the endpoint config file. Use `MaxConcurrency` to set the maximum number of messages that should be processed at any given time by the gateway instead.

## Automatic retries

In Versions 2 and above the gateway has its own retry mechanism. It will retry failed messages 4 times by default, increasing the delay by 60 seconds each time. The default retry policy can be [replaced](/nservicebus/gateway/#using-the-gateway-recoverability).


## Notifications

In Versions 2 and above the gateway does not provide any error notifications. When an error occurs during sending of a message to other sites, the message will be retried and possibly moved to the error queue.

Note that in Version 1, when [subscribing to error notifications](/nservicebus/recoverability/subscribing-to-error-notifications.md) the notification is received in the situation described above.
