## Externalize Windows Performance Counters

include: externalize-perfcounters

See [Externalize Windows Performance Counters](/nservicebus/upgrades/externalize-perfcounters.md) for more information.


## Outbox double opt-in mechanism removed

The requirement to enable the [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) both in code and in the configuration file has been removed. The `NServiceBus/Outbox` app setting is no longer required and should be removed. 

With NServiceBus 6.2, the Outbox can only be enabled via the code first API. See [Enabling the Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/#enabling-the-outbox) for more information.
