## Message Mutator Registration API

NServiceBus 6.2 provides a dedicated API to register [Message mutators](/nservicebus/pipeline/message-mutators.md) instead of registering them directly with the container.

Instead of:

```
endpointConfiguration.RegisterComponents(
    registration: components =>
    {
        components.ConfigureComponent<MyMutator>(DependencyLifecycle.InstancePerCall);
    });
```

use the new mutator registration API:

```
endpointConfiguration.RegisterMessageMutator(new MyMessageMutator());
```

See [Registering message mutators](/nservicebus/pipeline/message-mutators.md#registering-a-mutator) for more information.

Note that registering mutators directly via the container API will continue to work in all NServiceBus version 6 releases for backward compatibility reasons but will be removed in a future major version.
