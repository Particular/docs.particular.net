## RegisterObservers replaces basic methods

The `EnableMetricTracing`, `EnableCustomReport` and `EnableLogTracing` methods have been deprecated and replaced with the more extensible [`RegisterObservers`](/monitoring/metrics/raw.md#reporting-metrics-data-to-any-external-storage).

Also note that the older methods supported an `interval` TimeSpan. In the new API batching up metrics, and flushing them at a given interval, is the domain of the calling code.


### EnableMetricTracing

Replace with explicit calls to [Trace.WriteLine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.trace.writeline.aspx).

### EnableLogTracing

Replace with explicit calls to an [NServiceBus logger](/nservicebus/logging/usage.md).

### EnableCustomReport

Replace with explicit calls to the custom method.
