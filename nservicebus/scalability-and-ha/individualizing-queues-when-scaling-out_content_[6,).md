snippet:UniqueQueuePerEndpointInstanceDiscriminator

The code above instructs NServiceBus to start an additional receiver for a queue which name is generated by adding the provided instance ID to the base queue name (by default derived from the endpoint name). Both primary and additional receiver share the same message processing pipeline.

NOTE: Although it is possible to use NServiceBus client-size distribution feature to distribute load between instances with individualized queues, it should be avoided. Transport's built-in scalability feature should be used when available.
