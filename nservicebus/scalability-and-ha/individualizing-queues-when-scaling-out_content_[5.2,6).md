snippet: UniqueQueuePerEndpointInstance

The code above instructs NServiceBus to use a unique input queue name for each instance of an endpoint. The actual queue name is generated by adding an instance-specific suffix which is provided by transport or hosting infrastructure. 

Only Azure transports (AzureServiceBus and AzureStorageQueues) support this mode of operation. Role instance ID is used as a suffix.

When using different transport or full control over the suffix is required then following API can be used:

NOTE: There is no built-in mechanism of distributing the load between endpoints with individualized queue names. Queue name individualization should not be used as a mechanism for scaling out.
