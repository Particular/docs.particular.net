Depending on the transport being used it can be beneficial to run with a unique input queue per endpoint instance when scaling out since this avoids being limited by the throughput of a single queue. In this case all instances should share the same storage (for sagas, timeouts etc). This is achieved by keeping endpoint name the same since NServiceBus by default uses the endpoint name to select the database.

For this reason a new API has been from NServiceBus Version 5.2 that allows queue name individualization per endpoint while still keeping the endpoint name stable.

This will tell NServiceBus to use the suffix registered by the transport or host to make sure that each instance of the endpoint will be unique. For MSMQ this is a no-op since it is commonly scaled out by running multiple instances on different machines and that will give them a unique address out of the box. Eg: `sales@server1, sales@serverN` etc.

For broker transports that's no longer true, hence the need for a suffix. For on-premise operations the machine name is likely to be used and in cloud scenarios like on Azure the role instance ID is better suited since machines will dynamically change.

 * RabbitMQ example: `sales-server1, sales-serverN`
 * Azure Service Bus example: `sales-1, sales-N` where N is the role instance id
 * SQL Server transport ignores this setting altogether

If full control over the suffix is require or if the transport hasn't registered a default then it can be controlled using:

NOTE: In Version 5 there is no built-in mechanism of distributing the load between endpoints with individualized queue names. To use this feature to overcome the throughput limitation of single queues by using this, the distribution needs to be managed manually.
