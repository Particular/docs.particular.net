NOTE: Running an embedded distributor is not supported in Versions 6 and higher.  Distributor should not be used for new deployments, unless there is a need for backwards compatibility with Versions 5 or lower. Related configuration sections like `MasterNodeConfig` are obsoleted and `endpointConfiguraiton.EnlistWithLegacyMSMQDistributor` should be used instead. For more information refer to [Upgrading a Distributor-based scaled out endpoint to Version 6](/samples/scaleout/distributor-upgrade/) documentation.
