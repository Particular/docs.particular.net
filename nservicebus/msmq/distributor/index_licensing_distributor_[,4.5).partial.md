Basic licenses (default, express, Basic-2, 4, etc.) supports running distributor with two worker nodes.

If the [NServiceBus generic host](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/) is running with the NServiceBus.Master profile or if self hosting and the bus is initialized with RunDistributor() then only one additional worker can register with the distributor. Read more about the [Distributor and worker nodes](/nservicebus/msmq/distributor/).

Purchase of a standard license (or use of a time-limited trial license) removes the limitation of two worker nodes. Read more about [licensing](https://particular.net/licensing).
