Because MSMQ does not allow performant remote receives in most cases scaling out requires sender-side round-robin distribution. When using MSMQ different instances are usually deployed to different (virtual) machines. The following routing file (see [scaling out with sender-side distribution](sender-side-distribution.md)) shows scaling out of the `Sales` endpoint. System administrators are able to spin-up new instances of the endpoint should the load increase and the only requirement is adding an entry to the routing file. No changes in the source code are required.

WARNING: When using this scaling out technique in a mixed version environment make sure to deploy a distributor in front of the scaled out version 6 endpoint if that endpoint needs to subscribe to events published by endpoints using versions lower than 6 (refer to [the distributor sample](/samples/scaleout/distributor/) for details). Otherwise each event will be delivered to every instance of the scaled out endpoint.
