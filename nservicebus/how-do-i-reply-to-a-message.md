The simplest way to reply to a message is using the Reply method on `IBus`, like this:


```C#
public void Handle(RequestDataMessage message)
{
    //Create a response message
    var response = new DataResponseMessage
    { 
        DataId = message.DataId,
        String = message.String
    };
    
    Bus.Reply(response); 
    //Try experimenting with sending multiple responses
    //Bus.Reply(response); 
    //Underneath the covers, this method sends a new message to the return address on the message being handled.
    //Bus.Send(Bus.CurrentMessageContext.ReturnAddress, Bus.CurrentMessageContext.Id, responseMessage);
}
```

You should only use a reply when you implement the Request-Response pattern (also called the Full Duplex pattern). In this pattern the originator of the message should expect a response message and have a handler for it. See the [Full Duplex Sample](full-duplex-sample.md) provided with the install and the article [How to Handle Responses on the Client Side](how-do-i-handle-responses-on-the-client-side.md) for examples and more information.

When using the Publish-Subscribe pattern an endpoint handling an event shouldn't use `Bus.Reply`. This is because the publisher will not be expecting any reply and should not have a handler for it.
