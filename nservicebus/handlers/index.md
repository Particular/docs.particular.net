NServiceBus will take a message from the queue and hand it over to one or more message handlers. To create a message handler, write a class that implements `IHandleMessages<T>` where `T` is the message type:

snippet: CreatingMessageHandler

For scenarios that involve changing the application state via data access code in the handler, see [accessing data](/nservicebus/handlers/accessing-data.md).

To handle messages of all types:

 1. Set up the [message convention](/nservicebus/messaging/conventions.md) to designate which classes are messages. This example uses a namespace match.
 1. Create a handler of type `Object`. This handler will be executed for all messages that are delivered to the queue for this endpoint.

Since this class is setup to handle type `Object`, every message arriving in the queue will trigger it. Note that this might not be a recommended approach as [writing a behavior](/nservicebus/pipeline/manipulate-with-behaviors.md) is often a better solution.

include: non-null-task

If using the Request-Response or Full Duplex pattern, handlers will probably do the work it needs to do, such as updating a database or calling a web service, then creating and sending a response message. See [How to Reply to a Message](/nservicebus/messaging/reply-to-a-message.md).

If handling a message in a publish-and-subscribe scenario, see [How to Publish/Subscribe to a Message](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/).

### Mapping to name

Incoming messages will be mapped to a type using [Assembly Qualified Name](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname.aspx). This is the default behavior for sharing assemblies among endpoints. When a message cannot be mapped based on Assembly Qualified Name, the mapping will be attempted using [`FullName`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.fullname.aspx). The following is an example of how NServiceBus gets the type information.

```cs
var fqn = message.GetType().AssemblyQualifiedName;
var fallback = message.GetType().FullName;
```

## Behavior when there is no handler for a message

Receiving a message for which there are no message handlers is considered an error and the received message will be forwarded to the configured error queue.

## Multiple handlers

When an endpoint hosts multiple matching handlers for a single incoming message and one of the handlers fails then the incoming message gets retried. When the incoming message is retried all matching handlers get invoked again. Invoked handlers include the handlers that might had already been succesfully invoked in previous attempts.

In general, an incoming message represents a single unit of work. If multiple handlers get invoked it is best that either all succeed or all fail in a single transactional boundary. It is not recommended to run multiple atomic or isolated transactional operations for a single incoming message.

Ensure correct invocation of isolated or shared state by applying one of more of the strategies:

- Ensuring all handlers share the same transactional context to ensure any the shared transaction can rollback any operations (connection sharing, MSDTC, etc.).
- Ensuring handlers are idempotent and correctly deal with At-least-once Delivery.
- Hosting each handler in its own endpoint (hosting in isolation) so each subscribers receive its own own copy to process in isolation (multiple subscibers).
- When receiving the message do a `SendLocal` with a new message but same payload so that each task gets represented by itsÂ own message and can be executed in isolation. (single subscriber, split at the target).
- Send individual commands from the endpoint that publishes the event, instead of a single event (split at the source).

In general a generic message gets converted into several commands where each command represents a specific isolated task. Splitting in multiple message also has the benefit that each task can run in parallel where otherwise execution is sequential. 

## Unit testing

Unit testing handlers is supported by [the `NServiceBus.Testing` library](/nservicebus/testing/#testing-a-handler).
