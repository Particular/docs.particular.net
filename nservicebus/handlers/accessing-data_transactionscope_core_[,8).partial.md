### TransactionScope

> [!NOTE]
> This section applies only to .NET Framework as .NET Core does not support distributed transactions.

In .NET, using the [TransactionScope](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.transactions.transactionscope) makes a block of code transactional, i.e. any code that stores data will automatically enlist in the transaction.

This is configured on the transport and automatically includes any message handler.

As long as the database resource also supports distributed transactions, the code in a handler will automatically enlist in the transaction without additional configuration. If a handler fails in processing a message, the data in the datastore will be rolled back automatically.

When using a transaction mode lower than `TransactionScope`, NServiceBus also provides the ability to wrap handlers inside a TransactionScope to [avoid partial updates](/transports/transactions.md#avoiding-partial-updates).
