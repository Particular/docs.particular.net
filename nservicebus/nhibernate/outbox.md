The [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox) feature requires persistence in order to store the messages and enable deduplication.


## Table

To keep track of duplicate messages, the NHibernate implementation of Outbox requires the creation of `OutboxRecord` table.

## Deduplication record lifespan

The NHibernate implementation by default keeps deduplication records for 7 days and runs the purge every 1 minute.
