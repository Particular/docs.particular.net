Uses the [NHibernate ORM](http://nhibernate.info/) for persistence.


## Supported Persistence Types

 * [Gateway Deduplication](/nservicebus/gateway/)
 * [Sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/)
 * [Subscriptions](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/)
 * [Timeouts](/nservicebus/sagas/timeouts.md) (including   [message deferral](/nservicebus/messaging/delayed-delivery.md) and [delayed retries](/nservicebus/recoverability/#delayed-retries))
 * [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/)


## Supported database engines

 * [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/) ([Version 2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/release-notes/sql-server-2012-release-notes) and above).
 * [Oracle Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/index.html) ([Version 11g Release 2](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/readmes.112/e41331/chapter11204.htm) and above).


NOTE: When connecting to the Oracle Database, only the ODP.NET managed driver is supported.

WARNING: Although this persistence will run on the free version of the above engines, i.e. [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express) and [Oracle XE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/overview/index.html), it is strongly recommended to use commercial versions for any production system. It is also recommended to ensure that support agreements are in place from either [Microsoft Premier Support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftservices/support.aspx), [Oracle Support](https://www.oracle.com/support/index.html), or another third party support provider.


## Usage

The next stage is to actually tell NServiceBus how to use NHibernate for persistence

snippet: ConfiguringNHibernate


## Connection strings

It is possible to pass connection string in the `app.config` file, as described in the [Using configuration convention](/nservicebus/nhibernate/#customizing-the-configuration-using-configuration-convention) section.


partial: code-connection


## Customizing the configuration

To customize the NHibernate `Configuration` object used to bootstrap the persistence mechanism, either provide a ready-made object via code or use convention-based XML configuration. The code-based approach overrides the configuration-based one when both are used.


### Passing Configuration in code

To specific configuration on a per-concern basis, use following

snippet: SpecificNHibernateConfiguration

NOTE: Combine both approaches to define a common configuration and override it for one specific concern.

partial: code


### Using configuration convention

NServiceBus then picks up the connection setting from the `app.config` from `connectionStrings` and `appSettings` sections. The convention used for `appSettings` does not support defining settings specific for a single persistence concern. If this level of granularity is required use a code-based approach.

NOTE: When using SQL 2012 or later, change the dialect to `MsSql2012Dialect`. Additional dialects are available in the NHibernate.Dialect namespace, [NHibernate documentation.](http://nhibernate.info/doc/)

snippet: NHibernateAppConfig


## Change database schema

The database schema used can be changed by defining the `default_schema` NHibernate property. See the previous *Customizing the configuration* section.


## Subscription caching

The subscriptions can be cached when using NHibernate. This can improve the performance of publishing events as it is not required to request matching subscriptions from storage.

NOTE: Publishing is performed on stale data. This is only advised in high volume environments where latency can be a potential issue.

## Generating scripts for deployment

To create scripts, for execution in production without using the [installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md), run an install in a lower environment and then export the SQL structure. This structure can then be migrated to production.
