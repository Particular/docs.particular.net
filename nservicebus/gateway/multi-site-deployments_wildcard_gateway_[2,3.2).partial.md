## Incoming channels with wildcard URIs

Hosting in a dynamic environment, like Azure Service Fabric, can make it difficult to find the correct hostname to bind incoming channels to. Incoming channels with wildcard URIs are allowed from version 2.0.1 of the gateway to support this scenario. 

The supported format is `http://+:port/{name of the endpoint}`. For example, `http://+:25899/` will listen on port 25899 on any IP/hostname available on the machine. 

The channel URI  is used to populate the `ReplyTo` header of any messages sent by the gateway instance. Using a wildcard in the `ReplyTo` header makes little sense as it would not be routable back from a replying gateway. An additional default channel with a fully qualified URI is therefore required whenever incoming channels with wildcard URIs are used. The default channel uri will be used in the `ReplyTo` header of any message sent.
