## Persistence support

The gateway requires an NServiceBus persistence to operate although not all persisters support it. Currently, the gateway is supported only by InMemory, RavenDB, and NHibernate persisters. If the configured persister doesn't support gateway, an exception will be thrown at endpoint startup.


## Corrupted urlacls

At startup the gateway will attempt to recreate the urlacls so that the process can listen on a specific port. If they already exist, a warning is logged:

```
WARN NServiceBus.Installation.GatewayHttpListenerInstaller
Failed to grant to grant user 'Machine\UserName' HttpListener permissions. Processing will continue.
Try running the following command from an admin console:
netsh http add urlacl url=http://localhost:25894/MyEndpoint/ user="Machine\MyEndpointServiceAccount"

The error message from running the above command is:
Url reservation add failed, Error: 183
Cannot create a file when that file already exists.
```

This warning can usually be safely ignored. However when urlacls are corrupted the same behaviors occurs. This problem will manifest in that everything seems to be working correctly except that the gateway will not be listening on the port.

To verify this problem navigate to the url (in this case `http://localhost:25894/MyEndpoint/`) in a browser. If the gateway is listening the following will be received:

```
EndpointName:MyEndpoint - Status: Ok
```

If the gateway is not listening no response will be received.

To clean and recreate the url acl manually run the following commands from an admin console:

```shell
netsh http delete urlacl YourUrl
netsh http add urlacl url=YourUrl user="YourMachine\EndpointUsername"
```

For example

```shell
netsh http delete urlacl http://localhost:25894/MyEndpoint/
netsh http add urlacl url=http://localhost:25894/MyEndpoint/ user="Machine\MyEndpointServiceAccount"
```

To list all urlacls on a machine run

```shell
netsh http show urlacl
```
