Note: This means that the relevant `Handle` method on the saga will be invoked, even though the message might be later rolled back. Hence it is important to ensure not to perform any work in saga handlers that can't roll back together with the message. This also means that should there be high levels of concurrency there will be N-1 rollbacks where N is the number of concurrent messages. This can cause throughput issues and might require design changes.
