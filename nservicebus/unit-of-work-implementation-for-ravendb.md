title: Unit of Work Implementation For RavenDB
summary: Avoid repeating code in your message handlers by implementing the NServiceBus Unit of Work for RavenDB.

When using a framework like NServiceBus you usually need to create your own unit of work to avoid repeating code in your message handlers. Following is one approach on how to implement the NServiceBus Unit of Work for RavenDB.

## Sharing the session

Share the session between the message handler(s) and the actual unit of work implementation. Do not use thread static, which has issues mentioned by [Andreas Öhlund](http://andreasohlund.net/) in a [blog post](http://andreasohlund.net/2010/03/25/thread-static-caching-in-nservicebus/).

Instead, beginning with NServiceBus V3, use the new [support for child containers](nservicebus-support-for-child-containers.md). This means that all dependencies configured as a single call effectively become static within the context of one transport message.

To resolve a RavenDB document session from the container, add the following configuration (StructureMap is used but any of the other containers except Spring and Unity would work):


```C#
var store = new DocumentStore {Url = "http://localhost:8080", DefaultDatabase = "MyDatabase"};
store.Initialize();
 
ObjectFactory.Configure(c =>
    {
        c.For<IDocumentStore>()
            .Singleton()
            .Use(store);
        c.For<IDocumentSession>()
            .Use(ctx => ctx.GetInstance<IDocumentStore>()
                        .OpenSession());
        c.For<IManageUnitsOfWork>()
            .Use<RavenUnitOfWork>();
    });
 
Configure.With()
            .StructureMapBuilder(ObjectFactory.Container);
```

The above code tells the container to create a new `IDocumentSession` using the specified lambda. The fact that all message processing is done using a child container means that all message handlers processing the message get the same session instance.

## Implementing the unit of work

In RavenDB, to persist your data to the database, you need to explicitly call `IDocumentSession.SaveChanges()`. To avoid making this call in all the handlers, add a unit of work implementation. This saves typing and prevents you from forgetting to make the call:


```C#
public class RavenUnitOfWork : IManageUnitsOfWork
{
    private readonly IDocumentSession session;
 
    public RavenUnitOfWork(IDocumentSession session)
    {
        this.session = session;
    }
 
    public void Begin()
    {
    }
 
    public void End(Exception ex)
    {
        if (ex == null)
        {
            session.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}
```

NOTE: There is a dependency on the `IDocumentSession`. Given that the UoW is resolved from the same child container as the handlers, you will get the same session instance. RavenDB doesn't need any special setup so you only need to call `SaveChanges` if `End()` is called and no exception occurs.

To make NServiceBus use the UoW, configure it in the container so that NServiceBus finds and uses it:

```C#
c.For<IManageUnitsOfWork>()
    .Use<RavenUnitOfWork>();
```

## Disposing of the session

Rescue comes from the child containers together with the fact that the main container disposes of all single call components created in the child container together with the child container. NServiceBus disposes of the child container when it finishes processing a transport message, which means that any object implementing `IDisposable` is disposed of. Luckily, [IDocumentSession](https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/blob/master/Raven.Client.Lightweight/IDocumentSession.cs) does just this! So it is possible to create clean message handlers that interact with Raven:

```C#
public class PlaceOrderHandler : IHandleMessages<PlaceOrder>
{
    readonly IDocumentSession session;
 
    public PlaceOrderHandler(IDocumentSession session)
    {
        this.session = session;
    }
 
    public void Handle(PlaceOrder message)
    {
        session.Store(new Order
        {
            OrderId = message.OrderId
        });
    }
}
```

## Working code, please!

A [working sample](https://github.com/andreasohlund/Blog/tree/master/RavenUnitOfWork) is at [Andreas Öhlund's github account](https://github.com/andreasohlund/) . 

**NOTES** :

-The solution automatically downloads the required dependencies using NuGet.
-The sample assumes RavenDB is listening on `http://localhost:8080`.
