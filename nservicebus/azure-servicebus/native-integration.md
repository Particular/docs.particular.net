### BrokeredMessage body conventions

By default `BrokeredMessage` body is transmitted as a byte array. But for scenarios such as native integration, the body can be stored and retrieved using `Stream`. To specify how the `BrokeredMessage` body is stored and retrieved, override conventions provided by using `BrokeredMessageBodyConversion` class.

### Naming Conventions

To have a fine-grained control over entity names generated by the ASB transport, `NamingConventions` class exposes several conventions that can be overwritten to provide customization.

Entity sanitization:

This sanitization allows forward slash `/` in queue and topic names unlike default sanitization convention used by Azure Service Bus transport.

Entities creation:
