The behavior of each persister can be controlled by specifying one of the respective configuration sections in the `app.config` and changing available properties, or using code API. The exact same settings are exposed via `app.config` file and code configuration API.

### Configuration with Configuration Section

snippet:AzurePersistenceFromAppConfig

The following settings are available for changing the behavior of saga persistence through the `AzureSagaPersisterConfig` section:

- `ConnectionString`: Sets the connectionstring for the storage account to be used for storing saga information.  Defaults to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` in Versions 6 and below, and defaults to `null` in Versions 7 and above.
- `CreateSchema`: Instructs the persister to create the table automatically, defaults to `true`

The following settings are available for changing the behavior of subscription persistence through the `AzureSubscriptionStorageConfig` section:

- `ConnectionString`: Sets the connection string for the storage account to be used for storing subscription information.  Defaults to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` in Versions 6 and below, and defaults to `null` in Versions 7 and above.
- `CreateSchema`: Instructs the persister to create the table automatically, defaults to `true`
- `TableName`: Specifies the name of the table for storing subscriptions, defaults to `Subscription`.

The following settings are available for changing the behavior of timeout persistence through the `AzureTimeoutPersisterConfig` section:

- `ConnectionString`: Sets the connectionstring for the storage account to be used for storing timeout information.  Defaults to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` in Versions 6 and below, and defaults to `null` in Versions 7 and above.
- `TimeoutManagerDataTableName`: Sets the name of the table where the timeout manager stores it's internal state, defaults to `TimeoutManagerDataTable`
- `TimeoutDataTableName`: Sets the name of the table where the timeouts themselves are stored, defaults to `TimeoutDataTableName`
- `CatchUpInterval`: When a node hosting a timeout manager would go down, it needs to catch up with missed timeouts faster than it normally would (1 sec), this value  sets the catchup interval in seconds. Defaults to 3600, meaning it will process one hour at a time.
- `PartitionKeyScope`: The time range used as partition key value for all timeouts. For optimal performance, this should be in line with the catchup interval so it should come to no surprise that the default value also represents an hour: `yyyyMMddHH`. Data in the table defined by `TimeoutDataTableName` will need to be migrated When modifying `PartitionKeyScope`.
- `TimeoutStateContainerName`: Sets the name of the container where the timeout state is stored, defaults to `timeoutstate` - **Added in v7.0**
