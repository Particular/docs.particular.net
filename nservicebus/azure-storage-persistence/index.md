Certain features of NServiceBus require persistence to permanently store data. Among them are subscription storage, sagas, and timeouts. Various storage options are available including Azure Storage Services.


## How to enable persistence with Azure Storage Services

First add a reference to the assembly that contains the Azure storage persisters. When working with NServiceBus Version 5 or lower this is done by adding a NuGet package reference to `NServiceBus.Azure`. For NServiceBus Version 6 and above the NuGet package reference is `NServiceBus.Persistence.AzureStorage`.

If self hosting, configure the persistence technology using the configuration API.
