`NServiceBus.WormHole` is an alternative to the [Gateway](/nservicebus/gateway/) component of NServiceBus. Following table compares the most important aspects of both technologies.

## Topology

The Worm Hole-enabled system consists of *sites*. Sites can be geographically distributed. It is assumed that the connectivity within the site is much better than between the sites. Each site forms an independent NServiceBus system with its own set of infrastructure e.g. ServiceControl and ServicePulse.

Each site hosts a Worm Hole *gateway* which is a special node that allows to send messages to remote sites. Any given message type can be configured to be routed to the gateway (instead of to a regular endpoint). 

Worm Hole *tunnels* connect the gateways. Tunnels are always single-hop so a message always travels through exactly two gateways: it enters the tunnel through a gateway in the origin site and leaves it through a gateway in in the destination site.

The transport used to implement the tunnels need to be the same (and be configured with the same parameters) for all the gateways that take part in a given system.


## Transports

The key advantage of Worm Hole is the ability to run any NServiceBus transport, in addition to built-in HTTP transport, for exchanging messages between the sites. For interoperability reasons the most useful transports for the Worm Hole are these based on HTTP protocol.


### HTTP

The HTTP transport runs a HTTP listener in each Worm Hole gateway in a similar way to the standard NServiceBus Gateway. The advantage of listener-based approach is immunity to connection problems in the tunnel. When the connection is down the messages queue up on the sender side, waiting to be forwarded.

The disadvantage is the need to expose a HTTP endpoint in the public network.


### ASB and ASQ

As an alternative to the HTTP transport, Azure transports (ASB or ASQ) can be used as a tunnel transport. The advantage of Azure transports is ability to run the Worm Hole nodes behind firewall without the need to open any ports as the ASB/ASQ client does not run the HTTP listener.

The downside of ASB/ASQ is the need for the connection to up on all the time because the receive is implemented via long polling.


## Routing


The routing in Worm Hole is broken down into three areas:
 * The origin endpoint has to be configured to route messages of a given type to the local gateway
 * The origin site gateway has to have a tunnel configured for the destination site
 * The destination site gateway has to know which endpoint should receive the message


### Origin endpoint

The origin endpoint specifies the destination sites for a given message, either statically or based on the message content.

snippet: DestinationSites


### Origin gateway

In order to pass messages between the sites the Worm Hole gateways need to know their counterparts. Following code configures the two-way routing between `SiteA` and `SiteB`.

snippet: RemoteSiteA

snippet: RemoteSiteB  


### Destination gateway

The gateway in the destination site has to be configured to route the message to the ultimate destination endpoint. Following code show how to configure the routing on type-, namespace- and assembly-level.

snippet: DestinationEndpoints

#### Sender-side distribution

[Bus transports](/nservicebus/transports/#types-of-transports-bus-transports), such as MSMQ allow scaling out via [sender-side distribution](/nservicebus/msmq/sender-side-distribution.md). The Worm Hole allows to configure the sender-side distribution in the destination site.

NOTE: The snippet above contains a hard-coded list of instances. In real system it might be better to load the list of instances from a configuration file or database. The [file-based routing](/nservicebus/messaging/file-based-routing) extensions is a good starting point to see how this can be implemented.

## De-duplication

The messages travelling through a Worm Hole can get duplicated along the way, between the endpoints and the Worm Hole nodes or in the Worm Hole tunnel. The Worm Hole does not come with an integrated message de-duplication mechanism.

Worm Hole does, however, preserve the message ID between the source and the ultimate destination. The message ID can be used to de-duplicate at the destination. If the destination endpoint uses the [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) the de-duplication will be done automatically by means of the Outbox mechanism.
