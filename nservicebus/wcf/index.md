It is possible to expose the message send+receive action as a WCF service. In effect, this allows a WCF service call to be "proxied" through to a message being sent, and then wait for the response to return the WCF result.

NOTE: When doing a blocking send+receive inside a WCF service, the service implementation is a client of the [callback functionality](/nservicebus/messaging/callbacks.md).


## Prerequisites for WCF functionality

The WCF functionality is part of the [NServiceBus.Wcf NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Wcf). The package has a dependency to `NServiceBus.Callback`. The endpoint hosting the WCF services needs to configure the [callbacks accordingly](/nservicebus/messaging/callbacks.md).



## Expose a WCF service

To expose the endpoint as a WCF service, inherit from `NServiceBus.WcfService<TRequest, TResponse>`, as shown below. `TRequest` is the message type of the request. `TResponse` represents the result of processing the command and can be any type that is supported by the `NServiceBus.Callback` package.

Example:

snippet: ExposeWCFService


## Configure binding and address of WCF service

To expose the WCF service, change the configuration as shown below:

```xml
<system.serviceModel>
  <behaviors>
    <serviceBehaviors>
      <behavior name="Default">
        <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="true" />
        <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="true" />
      </behavior>
    </serviceBehaviors>
  </behaviors>
  <services>
    <service name="Server.WebServices.CancelOrderService"
             behaviorConfiguration="Default">
      <endpoint address="mex"
                binding="mexHttpBinding"
                contract="IMetadataExchange" />
      <host>
        <baseAddresses>
          <add baseAddress="http://localhost:9009/services/cancelOrder" />
        </baseAddresses>
      </host>
    </service>
  </services>
</system.serviceModel>
```

The service name in `<service name="XXX"` must match the [`Type.FullName`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.fullname.aspx) that derives from `NServiceBus.WcfService<TRequest, TResponse>`.

### OverrideBinding

It is also possible to configure the binding and address in code for each service type individually:

snippet: WcfOverrideBinding

The delegate is invoked for each service type discovered. The delegate needs to return a binding configuration which contains the binding instance to be used as well as optionally an absolute listening address.

### Int

The integer response scenario allows any integer value to be returned in a strong typed manner.

NOTE: The receiving endpoint requires a reference to `NServiceBus.Callbacks`.


#### Expose service

snippet: WcfIntCallback


#### Response

snippet: WcfIntCallbackResponse


### Enum

The enum response scenario allows any enum value to be returned in a strong typed manner.

NOTE: The receiving endpoint requires a reference to `NServiceBus.Callbacks`.


#### Expose service

snippet: WcfEnumCallback


#### Response

snippet: WcfEnumCallbackResponse


### Object

The Object response scenario allows an object instance to be returned.

NOTE: The receiving endpoint does not require a reference to `NServiceBus.Callbacks`.


#### The Response message

This feature leverages the message Reply mechanism of the bus and hence the response need to be a message.

snippet: WcfCallbackResponseMessage


#### Expose service

snippet: WcfObjectCallback


#### Response

snippet: WcfObjectCallbackResponse


## Cancellation

By default a request is canceled after 60 seconds. It is possible to override the cancellation behavior with:

snippet: WcfCancelRequest

The delegate is invoked for each service type discovered. The delegate needs to return a time span indicating how long a request can take until it gets canceled.


## Routing

By default a request is routed to the local endpoint instance. It is possible to override the routing behavior with:

snippet: WcfRouting

the replying endpoint handler:

snippet: WcfReplyFromAnotherEndpoint

The delegate is invoked for each service type discovered. The delegate needs to return a function delegate which creates a `SendOption` instance every time it is called.


## Queries and other return values

To allow clients to perform queries, it is best not to use NServiceBus. Messaging is designed for non-blocking operations and queries are operations for which the user usually must wait.

When performing operations that aren't as straightforward as a simple query to return a value, for example a long calculation, consider invoking the operation locally where possible by referencing the DLL on the client.


## Calling Web/WCF services

When invoking a Web/WCF service as a part of message handling logic, where that logic also updates transactional resources like a database, the best practice is to split it into two endpoints.

If no response is required from the Web/WCF service then use [publish-subscribe](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/). Have the first endpoint publish an event, to which the second endpoint subscribes, and have the second endpoint call the Web/WCF service.

If a response is required from the Web/WCF service, turn the first endpoint into a [saga](/nservicebus/sagas/) that sends (_not_ publishes) a message to the second endpoint, which calls the Web/WCF service and [replies](/nservicebus/messaging/reply-to-a-message.md) with a response that is handled by the saga in the first endpoint.
