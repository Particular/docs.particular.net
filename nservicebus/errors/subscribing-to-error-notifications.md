Error notifications are available for several events.

 * When a first level retry occurs.
 * When a second level retry occurs.
 * When a message fails all retries and is forwarded to the error queue.

This API was added in Version 5.1.

These event are exposed via the `BusNotifications` (NServiceBus Version 5) or `Notifications` (NServiceBus Version 6) class. This class can be injected using the [container](/nservicebus/containers).

The following example shows how to be notified every time a message is sent to FLR, SLR or the error queue. While this code writes to the console any other action could be taken, for example sending an email or writing to a monitoring system.

## Reactive Extensions

Between Version 5.1 and before Version 6 the subscription was done via [Reactive Extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/data/gg577609.aspx).


## Unsubscribing

Since notifications are global for the current endpoint it is also important to ensure no longer required subscriptions removed so as to nor unnecessarily impact performance.

In Version 6 and above this is done by detaching from the event.

In Version 5.1 and before Version 6 this is done by keeping a reference to the `IDisposable` object returned from calling the `Subscribe` method on the [IObservable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd782981.aspx) and calling its `Dispose` method.
