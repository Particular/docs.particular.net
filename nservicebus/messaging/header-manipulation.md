The mechanism for [header communication](/nservicebus/messaging/headers.md) is either native headers, if the transport supports that feature, or via a serialized collection of key value pairs. This article covers the various ways of manipulating the message headers.


## Reading incoming headers

Headers can be read for an incoming message.


### From a behavior

snippet: header-incoming-behavior


### From a mutator

snippet: header-incoming-mutator


### From a handler

snippet: header-incoming-handler


### From a saga

snippet: header-incoming-saga


## Writing outgoing headers

Headers can be written for an outgoing message.


### From a behavior

snippet: header-outgoing-behavior


### From a mutator

snippet: header-outgoing-mutator


### From a handler

snippet: header-outgoing-handler


### From a saga

snippet: header-outgoing-saga


### For all outgoing messages

NServiceBus supports registering headers at configuration time that are then added to all outgoing messages for the endpoint.
