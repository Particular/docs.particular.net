Shows the usage of the `NServiceBus.Callback.Testing`.


## Prerequisites for callback testing functionality

The approach shown here works with the `NServiceBus.Callbacks` NuGet package version 1.1 or greater. Install the `NServiceBus.Callbacks.Testing` NuGet package.


### Int

The integer response scenario allows any integer value to be returned in a strong typed manner.


#### Testing

The response type returned by the `When` definition needs to be of type `int`.

snippet: IntCallbackTesting


### Enum

The enum response scenario allows any enum value to be returned in a strong typed manner.


#### Testing

The response type returned by the `When` definition needs to be of the enum type expected.

snippet: EnumCallbackTesting


### Object

The Object response scenario allows an object instance to be returned.


#### Testing

The response type returned by the `When` definition needs to be of the object response type expected.

#### Testing with SendOptions

The `When` definition provides a matcher overload which allows to match against the response and the send options passed into the callback function.

## Cancellation

The asynchronous callback can be canceled by registering a `CancellationToken` provided by a `CancellationTokenSource`.
