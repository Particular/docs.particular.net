This will result in, when an invalid message being detected, a validation exception being thrown and that message being handled by [Recoverability](/nservicebus/recoverability/). The validation exception will also be added to [Unrecoverable exceptions](/nservicebus/recoverability/#unrecoverable-exceptions) so as to avoid unnecessary retries.
