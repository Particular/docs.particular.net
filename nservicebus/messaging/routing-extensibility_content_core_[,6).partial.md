The routing system can be extended by providing custom sources of routing information to enrich or replace the standard routing configuration (`UnicastBusConfig/MessageEndpointMappings` configuration section in `app.config` file).

It can be done either by using a configuration source:

snippet:endpoint-mapping-configurationsource

snippet:inject-endpoint-mapping-configuration-source

or a configuration provider:

snippet:endpoint-mapping-configurationprovider

The `MessageEndpointMappings` collection can be populated based on any external source. It is read during the endpoint start-up, before any messages are sent. Extending the routing with a custom data source makes sense in following scenarios:

 * When centralizing all routing information in a database
 * When dynamically calculating routes based on endpoint discovery protocol (similar of UDDI)
 * When using a convention based on massage naming

NOTE: The route table is not updated during run-time, even if the contents of the mappings collection change. In case the routing data changes frequently, consider implementing a mechanism that would restart the endpoint when the change is detected.
