{{NOTE:
Duplicate timeouts can be dispatched if the transport and persistence is configured not to use or does not support [TransactionScope mode](/transports/transactions.md#transactions-transaction-scope-distributed-transaction). Scaled-out environments are extra vulnerable. The receiving endpoint must account for that via for example [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) or otherwise idempotent processing.

Exact-once timeouts are only possible with [MSMQ](/transports/msmq/) or [SQL](/transports/sql/) transports with [NHibernate](/persistence/nhibernate/) or [SQL](/persistence/sql/) Persistence **and** configured to share the transactional context (distributed transactions or connection sharing).

NServiceBus provides a delayed-delivery implementation for transports that don't support it natively. All Transports except MSMQ support delayed delivery natively.

The delayed-delivery feature uses a built-in persistent store and requires using NServiceBus persistence. The timeout data is stored in three different locations at various stages of processing: `[endpoint_queue_name].Timeouts` queue, timeouts storage location specific for the chosen persistence (e.g. dedicated table or document type) and `[endpoint_queue_name].TimeoutsDipatcher` queue. The queues are automatically created by [NServiceBus installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) when setting up the endpoint.

### Storing timeout messages

When NServiceBus detects that an outgoing message should be delayed, it routes it to to the `[endpoint_queue_name].Timeouts` queue instead of directly to the destination queue. The ultimate destination address is preserved in a header. 

The `[endpoint_queue_name].Timeouts` queue is monitored by NServiceBus [internal receiver](/nservicebus/satellites). The receiver picks up timeout messages and stores them using the selected NServiceBus persistence. 

The delayed messages will be stored for the specified delay time, using persistance implementation specified in the configuration:

snippet: configure-persistence-timeout

### Retrieving expired timeouts

NServiceBus periodically retrieves expiring timeouts from persistence. When a timeout expires, then a message with that timeout ID is sent to the `[endpoint_queue_name].TimeoutsDipatcher` queue. That queue is monitored by NServiceBus internal receiver. When the receiver picks up a message, it looks up the corresponding timeout in the storage. If it finds it, it dispatches the timeout message to the destination queue.

### Handling of persistence errors

If there are any connection problems with the timeout storage then by default NServiceBus waits for 2 minutes to allow the storage to come back online. If the problem is not resolved within that time frame, then a [Critical Error](/nservicebus/hosting/critical-errors.md) is raised.

The default wait time can be changed:

snippet: TimeToWaitBeforeTriggeringCriticalErrorOnTimeoutOutages

NOTE: The timeout manager polls every minute. This means it could take more time then the configured *TimeToWaitBeforeTriggeringCriticalErrorOnTimeoutOutages* value before an issue is detected.

When this happens the following critical error message will be raised:

> Repeated failures when fetching timeouts from storage, endpoint will be terminated.

If the NServiceBus.Host is used then the host will execute a fail-fast as documented in the [default critical error behavior for the NServiceBus.Host](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/#endpoint-configuration-default-critical-error-action).
