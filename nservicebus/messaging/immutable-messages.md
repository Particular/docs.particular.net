Usually messages are designed as [DTOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object), i.e. a plain class with public properties. This model is simple and will always work. Immutable messages are sometimes considered from a coding philosophy that messages should not be able to be changed after they are created.

Note: Serialized messages are immutable once on the wire, changing property values will not result in a message that is forwarded to an error or audit queue to contain a different value.

Message objects can be made immutable at runtime by:

1. Creating properties with only public getters and initializing these properties via constructor initialization.
2. Having regular message classes with public getters/setters at the sender, where these classes implement an interface with only public getters. Receivers reference only the interface.


## Properties with only public getters

Note: [Not all serializers support deserialization to private setters](/nservicebus/serialization/).

```c#
public class CancelOrder : ICommand
{
    public CancelOrder(int orderId)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
    }

    public int OrderId { get; private set; }
}
```

## Classes with public setters, interfaces with only getters

Using private setters is not supported by all serializers. An alternative is to make use of NServiceBus's support for [multiple inheritance and polymorphic dispatch](/nservicebus/messaging/messages-as-interfaces.md). In this case, a message contract is defined through an interface containing getters only, which is used by the message handler. An implementation of the message contract, which exposes public setters, is used to create the message and pass it to `Send` or `Publish`.

Note: Not all transport configurations support polymorphic dispatch.

```c#
public class CancelOrder : ICancelOrder
{
    public CancelOrder(int orderId)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
    }

    public int OrderId { get; set; } // Public setter
}


public interface ICancelOrder : IMessage
{
    int OrderId { get; } // Only getter
}
```
