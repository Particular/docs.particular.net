The message doesn't have to be dispatched immediately after sending, it can be delivered at a later time if necessary. In Versions 6 and above, this is accomplished by calling methods on an instance of `SendOptions` that is passed into `Send(...)` calls. In Versions 5 and below this can be achieved by using `bus.Defer(...)` instead of `bus.Send(...)`.

NOTE: Only send operations can be deferred. Publish and reply operations cannot be deferred.


## Delaying message dispatching


### Versions 6 and above: Delay message delivery

Delaying a message is done using `SendOptions` and the `DelayDeliveryWith` method. This allows to defer the actual sending of a message to any endpoint. The behavior of delayed handling using `DelayDeliveryWith` can be seen in [Delayed Delivery Sample](/samples/delayed-delivery).


### Versions 5 and below: Defer message handling

Calling `bus.Defer(...)` the handling of the message is deferred by certain amount of time. After that time the message is passed to be handled by the same endpoint. Semantically `bus.Defer(...)` is equivalent to calling `bus.SendLocal(...)` after time condition is met. See also [sending local](/nservicebus/messaging/send-a-message.md#sending-to-self).

Using this mechanism delayed delivery can be achieved by calling `bus.Defer(...)` which can be seen in [Delayed Delivery Sample](/samples/delayed-delivery).


## Using a TimeSpan

Delays delivery of a message for a specified duration.

## Using a DateTime

Delays delivery of a message until a specified point in time.

## Caveats

Delayed delivery of messages is only supported when the following requirements are met:

* The Timeout Manager feature is enabled or
* The transport support delayed delivery natively
* The endpoint is not a send-only endpoint.

When deferring a message, it is sent to the timeout manager requesting it to deliver the message at a later time or deferred by using the transports native capability to defer messages.

snippet:configure-timeout-manager

NOTE: In Versions 4, 5 and 6 Timeout Manager is enabled by default. In Version 6 the timeout manager disables itself automatically when the endpoint is a send-only endpoint or the transport support delayed delivery natively.

NOTE: The sending endpoint must be running when the timeout is reached in order for the message to be sent. If the endpoint is not running when the timeout is reached then the message will be sent when the endpoint is next started.

NOTE: If specifying a negative timeout or a time that is in the past then the message will still be slightly delayed. The message will not be sent until the timeout manager has processed the request.


## Persistence

Delayed messages are persisted (stored in a durable storage) in a location specified for `Timeouts`. The messages will be stored for the specified delay time. Sample persistence configuration for Timeouts can be seen below.
