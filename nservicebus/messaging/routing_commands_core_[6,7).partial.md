Command routing can be configured in code. The routing API is attached to the transport configuration object because some routing APIs are transport-specific. The routes can be specified at assembly, namespace or specific type levels.

snippet: Routing-Logical

The routing engine prevents ambiguous routes so if route information comes from more than one source (e.g. code API and configuration file) the user has to make sure the type specifications do not overlap. If they do overlap, an exception will be thrown preventing the endpoint from starting up.

Command routing can also be configured via [MessageEndpointMappings](routing-extensibility.md?version=Core_6#messageendpointmappings).
