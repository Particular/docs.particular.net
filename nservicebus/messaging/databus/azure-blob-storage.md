Azure Blob Storage DataBus will **remove** the [Azure storage blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs) used for physical attachments after the message is processed if the `TimeToBeReceived` value is specified. When this value isn't provided, the physical attachments will not be removed.


## Usage

snippet: AzureDataBus


## Cleanup strategies

Discarding old Azure DataBus attachments can be performed in one of the following ways:

1. Using built-in method (enabled by default)
2. Using Azure Durable Function
3. Using Blob Lifecycle Management policy

### Using built-in clean-up method

Specify a value for the `TimeToBeReceived` property. For more details on how to specify this, see the article on [discarding old messages](/nservicebus/messaging/discard-old-messages.md).

WARN: the built-in method executed continuous blob scanning. This can add up to the cost of the storage operations. It is **not** recommended for multiple endpoints that are scaled out. In case this method is not used and alternative is implemented, see how to disable built-in cleanup below. 

### Using Azure Durable Function

Alternatively, consider disabling Blob cleanup using Azure DataBus. Instead, use [Durable Azure Function](/samples/azure/blob-storage-databus-cleanup-function/) to perform this functionality.

### Using Blob Lifecycle Management policy

Attachment blobs can be cleaned up using [Blob Storage Lifecycle feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts). This method allows configuring a single policy for all DataBus related blobs. Those blobs can be either deleted or archived. The policy does not require custom code and is deployed directly to the storage account. This feature can only be used on GPv2 and Blob storage accounts, not on GPv1 accounts. 


## Configuration

The following extension methods are available for changing the behavior of `AzureDataBus` defaults:

partial: settings

### Disabling Blob Cleanup

Setting the `CleanupInterval` to `0` will disable blob cleanup.
