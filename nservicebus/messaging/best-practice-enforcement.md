By default, [messaging best practices](messages-events-commands.md) are enforced for messages defined as either commands or events.

NOTE: In NServiceBus versions 6 and above, the default behavior can be overridden.

This feature can be disabled at the endpoint level using:

snippet: DisableBestPracticeEnforcementPerEndpoint

or at the message level using:

snippet: DisableBestPracticeEnforcementPerMessage
