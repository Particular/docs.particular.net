WARNING: Callbacks should be only used in exceptional situations, e.g., to introduce messaging behind a synchronous API in a legacy component that can't be changed. They allow for gradually transitioning applications towards messaging. See also [When to use callbacks](/nservicebus/messaging/callbacks.md#when-to-use-callbacks) section for more information.
