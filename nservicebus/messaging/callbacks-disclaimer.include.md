WARNING: Callbacks should only be used in exceptional situations, for example, to introduce messaging behind a synchronous API in a legacy component that can't be changed. They allow gradually transitioning applications towards messaging. See the [when to use callbacks](/nservicebus/messaging/callbacks.md#when-to-use-callbacks) section for more information.
