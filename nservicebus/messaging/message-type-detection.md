NServiceBus sets the [`NServiceBus.EnclosedMessageTypes` header](/nservicebus/messaging/headers.md#serialization-headers-nservicebus-enclosedmessagetypes) to the [AssemblyQualifiedName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname) of the emitted message type when sending, publishing or replying.

It is possible to change the enclosed message type header for all emitted messages by using a behavior. The [consumer-driven-contracts sample](/samples/consumer-driven-contracts) shows how to manipulate the header for outgoing messages.

To invoke the correct message handlers for incoming messages, NServiceBus must be able to map the incoming transport message to a [message type](/nservicebus/messaging/messages-events-commands.md).

The mapping rules are as follows:

1. If the message contains the [`NServiceBus.EnclosedMessageTypes` header](/nservicebus/messaging/headers.md#serialization-headers-nservicebus-enclosedmessagetypes), the header value is used to find the message type. The header value may contain:
   - The [AssemblyQualifiedName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname) of the message type (with or without private key are both supported). In cases when the assembly qualified type is not known by the endpoint NServiceBus will fall back to any loaded type that matches the contained FullName, even when the type resides in a different assembly. 
   - The [FullName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.type.fullname) of the message type. NServiceBus will map it to any loaded type that matches the specified FullName, even when the type resides in a different assembly.
   - The Name of the type, without the assembly name.
1. If the header is missing, some serializers can optionally [infer the message type](/nservicebus/serialization/#security-message-type-inference) based on the message payload. Serializers that support message type inference:
   - [XML](/nservicebus/serialization/xml.md#inferring-message-type-from-root-node-name) via the root node name
   - [JSON.NET](/nservicebus/serialization/newtonsoft.md#inferring-message-type-from-type) via a custom `$type` property
