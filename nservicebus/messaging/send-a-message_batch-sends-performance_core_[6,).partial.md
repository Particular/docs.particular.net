NOTE: `Send` is an asynchronous operation - when the invocation ends it does not mean that the message has actually been sent. In scenarios where a large number of messages are sent in a short period it might be beneficial, from performance perspective, to limit number of outstanding send operations pending for completion. Sample approaches that can be used to limit the number of send tasks can be found in [Writing Async Handlers](/nservicebus/handlers/async-handlers.md#concurrency-large-amount-of-concurrent-message-operations).
