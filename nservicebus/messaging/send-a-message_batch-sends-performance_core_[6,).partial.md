NOTE: In Version 6 and higher `Send` is an asynchronous operation - when the invocation ends it does not mean that the message has already been sent. In scenarios when large amount of messages are sent all at once it might be beneficial, from performance perspective to limit number of outstanding send operations pending for completion. Sample approaches that can be used to limit the number of send tasks can be found in the [guide](/nservicebus/handlers/async-handlers#concurrency-large-amount-of-concurrent-message-operations) on writing async handlers.
