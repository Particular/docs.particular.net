NOTE: `Send` is an asynchronous operation. When the invocation ends, it does not mean that the message has actually been sent. In scenarios where a large number of messages are sent in a short period, it might be beneficial, from a performance perspective, to limit the number of outstanding send operations pending for completion. Sample approaches that can be used to limit the number of send tasks can be found in [Writing Async Handlers](/nservicebus/handlers/async-handlers.md#concurrency-large-amount-of-concurrent-message-operations).
