## Concept 

Centralized file-based routing is an alternative approach to configure message routing information and event subscribers via an XML file. The routing file can be configured once and then shared across all endpoints for easier routing and publish/subscribe management.


## Configuration

Enable the feature in via the routing configuration:

snippet: Enable

This will configure the endpoint to look for a `endpoints.xml` file in the endpoints [base directory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.basedirectory.aspx).

The routing file path can be configured using relative or absolute paths, e.g.:

snippet: EnableCustomPath

It is also possible to provide an Uri to the routing file (supporting `http[s]` and `file` protocols):

snippet: EnableCustomUri

The routing file provides routing information like shown in the following example:
    
Create a new XML file named `endpoints.xml` and include it on every endpoint using file based routing. 

snippet: EndpointsByType

The `type` attribute needs to provide the [Assembly Qualified Type Name](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname.aspx).
Make sure that the routing file is copied to the binaries output folder.

Instead of defining every single message type, it's also possible to configure entire assemblies or namespaces in bulk:

snippet: EndpointsByAssembly


### Updating the routing configuration

The routing configuration is read every 30 seconds, therefore the topology can change at runtime (e.g. unsubscribe an endpoint by removing its `event` entry from the `handles` collection). If the routing file is no longer valid after an update, the endpoint continues to use the previously loaded routing file.


### Sharing the routing file

In order to allow centralized configuration of the routing file, the file needs to be shared with the endpoints. This can be done in various ways, e.g.

 * Make the file available via a shared network folder.
 * Distribute the file as a part of deployment process.
 * Include the file in the project/solution and its build artifacts. Note: This approach does not allow for a centralized routing file management out of the box.


## Scaling out

It's possible to use sender-side distribution to scale out messages and events to multiple instances of the same logical endpoint. This is done with the [instance mapping file](/transports/msmq/routing.md).
