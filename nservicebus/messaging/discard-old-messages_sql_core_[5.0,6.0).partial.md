The SQL Server transport runs a periodic task that removes expired messages from the queue. The task is first executed when the endpoint starts and is subsequently scheduled to execute 5 minutes after the previous run when the task has been completed. The transport also evaluates the TimeToBeReceived for a message when the message is received from the queue. This helps to promptly discard expired messages that arrive at the front of the queue between scheduled executions of the purging task.
