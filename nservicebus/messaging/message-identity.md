title: Message Identity
summary: How are individual messages identified?
---

Each message that is dispatched from an Endpoint has a unique identity. NServiceBus will store this value as a header on the message (`NServiceBus.MessageId`). Depending on the selected transport, this identity may be used at the transport level as well.

The `NServiceBus.MessageId` header can be used by features to uniquely identify a message. The Outbox feature uses this header to deduplicate incoming messages. ServiceInsight uses this header when building up it's diagrams.

By default, message identity is generated by NServiceBus as a GUID. If required, this behavior can be overwritten.

WARN: It is important that the strategy used to generate message identities results in globally unique identifiers. If two messages ever have the same identity then some features will treat them as the same message. This will cause errors that are difficult to diagnose.

In Version 6 and above it is possible to set the message identity using the 

```CSharp
// move to snippet
sendOptions.SetMessageId(someUniqueId);
```
