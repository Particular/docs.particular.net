## Defining events

The messages need to be declared as an event before they can be published. That can be done with marker interfaces or using message conventions.


### Via a Marker interface

Add `IEvent` marker interface to the message definition:

snippet: EventWithInterface


### Via Message Conventions

The following message:

snippet: EventWithConvention

can be declared as an event using the following convention:

snippet: DefiningEventsAs

Learn more about [conventions](/nservicebus/messaging/conventions.md) and [unobtrusive mode](/nservicebus/messaging/unobtrusive-mode.md).


## Handling an event

In order to handle an event, implement `IHandleMessages<T>` interface in any [Handler](/nservicebus/handlers) or [Saga](/nservicebus/sagas) class, where `T` is the specific event type.


## Publishing an event

In order to publish an event call the `Publish` method. 

There are a few common scenarios for publishing events. Events might be published:

- from a **handler**, when processing another message.

snippet: publishFromHandler

- from a **saga handler**, when processing another message.

snippet: publishFromSaga

- at endpoint startup

snippet: publishAtStartup


## Events as Classes or Interfaces

NServiceBus messages can be implemented either as classes or [interfaces](/nservicebus/messaging/messages-as-interfaces.md). Since interfaces cannot be instantiated directly, use the following API to publish events implemented as interfaces:

snippet: InterfacePublish

When the event message is declared as an interface, NServiceBus will generate a proxy, set properties and publish the message. It's equivalent to the following call:

snippet: InstancePublish
