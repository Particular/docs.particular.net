A *message* is the unit of communication for NServiceBus. There are two types of messages, _commands_ and _events_, that capture more of the intent and help NServiceBus enforce messaging best practices. This enforcement is enabled by default, but can be [disabled](best-practice-enforcement.md).

Command | Event
-- | --
Used to _make a request to perform an action_. | Used to _communicate that an action has been performed_.
Has one logical owner. | Has one logical owner.
Should be _sent to_ the logical owner. | Should be _published by_ the logical owner.
Cannot be _published_. | Cannot be _sent_.
_Cannot_ be subscribed to or unsubscribed from. | _Can_ be subscribed to and unsubscribed from.
_Can_ be sent using the [gateway](/nservicebus/gateway). | _Cannot_ be sent using the [gateway](/nservicebus/gateway).

Note: In a request and response pattern, _reply_ messages are neither a command nor an event.


### Validation

There are checks in place to ensure best practices are followed. Violations of the above guidelines generate the following exceptions:

partial: errors


## Designing messages

Messages represent data contracts between endpoints. They should be designed according to the following guidelines.
 
Messages should:

* be simple [POCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_CLR_object) types.
* be as small as possible.
* satisfy the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle). Types used for other purposes (e.g. domain objects, data access objects, or UI binding objects) should not be used as messages.

Note: Prior to version 7.2, messages had to be defined as a `class`. Defing them as a `struct` would result in a runtime exception.

## Identifying messages

Endpoints will process any message that can be deserialized into a .NET type but requires message contracts to be identified up front to support:

* [Automatic subscriptions](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/controlling-what-is-subscribed.md) for event types
* [Routing based on `namespace` or `assembly`](/nservicebus/messaging/routing.md) for commands

Messages can be defined either by implementing a marker interface or by specifying a custom convention.

### Marker interfaces

The simplest way to identify messages is to use interfaces.

* `NServiceBus.ICommand` for a command.
* `NServiceBus.IEvent` for an event.
* `NServiceBus.IMessage` for any other type of message (e.g. a _reply_ in a request response pattern).

```cs
public class MyCommand : ICommand { }

public class MyEvent : IEvent { }

public class MyMessage : IMessage { }
```

### Conventions

To avoid having message contract assemblies reference the NServiceBus assembly, [custom conventions](/nservicebus/messaging/conventions.md) can be used to identify the types used as contracts for messages, commands, and events. This is known as [unobtrusive mode](unobtrusive-mode.md).
