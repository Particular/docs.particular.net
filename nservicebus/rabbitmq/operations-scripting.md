Example code and scripts to facilitate deployment and operational actions against RabbitMQ.

NOTE: Using statements omitted from below code for simplicity

These samples use the [RabbitMQ.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Client/) NuGet.

Since RabbitMQ.Client is not [CLS Compliant](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.clscompliantattribute.aspx) it is not possible to run this code within PowerShell.
