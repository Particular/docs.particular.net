## Configuring RabbitMQ transport to be used

To make NServiceBus use RabbitMQ as the underlying transport you need to add this to your configuration:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-basic

In order to work the transport needs to connect the the RabbitMQ broker. By default the transport will look for a connection string called `NServiceBus/Transport` in your app.config.

A typical connection string would look like this:

snippet:rabbitmqconnectionstring

In the above sample we tell the transport to connect to the RabbitMQ broker running at the machine `broker1`.

Below is the full list of connection string options. Note that you needs to separate them with a `;`.

 * `Port`: The port where the broker listens. Defaults to `5672`
 * `VirtualHost`: The [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html) to use. Defaults to `/`
 * `UserName`: The username when connecting. Defaults to `guest`
 * `Password`: The password when connecting. Defaults to `guest`
 * `RequestedHeartbeat`: The interval for the heartbeats between the client and the server. Defaults to `5` seconds
 * `DequeueTimeout` The time period allowed for the dequeue strategy to dequeue a message. Defaults to `1` second
 * `PrefetchCount`: The number of messages to [prefetch](http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html) when consuming messages from the broker. Defaults to the number of configured threads for the transport(as of v2.1)
 * `UsePublisherConfirms`: Controls if [publisher confirms](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html) should be used. Defaults to `true`
 * `MaxWaitTimeForConfirms`: How long the client should wait for publisher confirms if enabled. Defaults to `30` seconds.
 * `RetryDelay`: The time to wait before trying to reconnect to the broker if connection is lost. Defaults to `10` seconds

If you prefer to use a custom name for you connection string use:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-connectionstringname

or if you want to specify the connection string in code:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-connectionstring-in-code

For debugging purposes, you can increase the `RequestedHeartbeat` and `DequeueTimeout` like this:

### Callback support

RabbitMQ is a broker which means that you scale out by adding more endpoints feeding of the same broker queue. This usually works fine if no state is shared between the different instances. This is not the case for callbacks since they do rely on local state kept in memory. In order to seamlessly support this scenario out of the box the RabbitMQ transport has the concept of a callback receiver. Essentially this is a separate queue named `{endpointname}.{machinename}` to which all callbacks are routed. This means that callbacks are handled by the same instance that requested them. This behavior is on by default and if you're not using callbacks you can disable it using the following configuration:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-disablecallbackreceiver

This means that the queue will not be created and no extra threads will be used to fetch messages from that queue.

By default 1 dedicated thread is used for the callbacks but if you want to add more threads due to a high rate of callbacks being used you can control the threads count using:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-callbackreceiver-thread-count


### Controlling the message id strategy

By default NServiceBus uses the `message-id` property of the AMQP standard to relay the message id. If this header isn't set the transport will throw an exception since NServiceBus needs a message id in order to perform retries, de-duplication etc. in a safe way. In integration scenarios where you don't control the sender you might want to use your own custom scheme that extracts the message id from e.g.a custom header or some data contained in the actual message body. In these cases you can plug in your own strategy by calling:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-custom-id-strategy

WARNING: It is extremely important to use a uniquely identifying property of the message in a custom message id strategy. If the value for a message were to change (for example, if attempting to use `Guid.NewGuid().ToString()`) then message retries would break, as the infrastructure would be unable to determine that it was processing the same message repeatedly.


### Getting full control over the broker connection

The default connection manager that comes with the transport is usually good enough for most users. But if you want full control over how the connection(s) with the broker is managed you can implement you own connection manager. To do this you need to create your own class inheriting from `IManageRabbitMqConnections`. This requires you to provide a connection for:

 1. Administrative actions like creating queues and exchanges
 2. Publishing messages to the broker
 3. Consuming messages from the broker

In order for the transport to use you new connection manager you need to register it as shown below:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-useconnectionmanager


### Controlling behavior when broker connection is lost

By the default the RabbitMQ transport will trigger the on critical error action when it continuously fails to connect to the the broker for 2 minutes. This can now be customized using the following configuration setting: (values must be parsable to `System.TimeSpan`)

### Changing routing topology

By default the RabbitMQ transport create separate exchanges for each message type, including inherited types, being published in the system. This means that polymorphic routing and multiple inheritance for events is supported since each subscriber will bind its input queue to the relevant exchange based on the event types that it has handlers for.

For less complex scenarios you can use the `DirectRoutingTopology` that routes all events through a single exchange, `amq.topic` by default. The events will be published using a routing key based on the event type and subscribers will use that key to filter their subscriptions.

To enable direct routing you would use the following configuration:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-usedirectroutingtopology

You can adjust the conventions for exchange name and routing key by using the overload:

snippet:rabbitmq-config-usedirectroutingtopologywithcustomconventions

If the routing topologies mentioned above isn't flexible enough for you we allow you to take full control over how routing is done by implementing your own custom routing topology. This is done by:

1. Define the topology by creating a class implementing `IRoutingTopology`
2. Register it with the transport calling `.UseRoutingTopology` as shown below

snippet:rabbitmq-config-useroutingtopology
