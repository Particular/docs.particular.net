Using [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json) via a NuGet dependency on [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).


## How the NServiceBus core uses Json.net

The core of [NServiceBus uses Json.net](json.md). However it is [ILMerged](https://github.com/Microsoft/ILMerge) where this library has a standard dll and NuGet dependency. While ILMerging reduces versioning issues in the core it does cause several restrictions:

 * Can't use a different version of Json.net
 * Can't use Json.net attributes
 * Can't customize the Json.net serialization behaviors.

These restrictions do not apply to this serializer.


## Compatibility with the core JSON serializer

The only incompatibility with the [core serializer](json.md) is that this serializer does not support the serialization of `XContainer` and `XDocument` properties. If XML properties are required on messages strings should be used instead.


{{WARNING:
This serializer is not compatible with multiple bundled messages (when using the `Send(object[] messages)` APIs) sent from Versions 3 and below of NServiceBus. If this scenario is detected then an exception with the following message will be thrown: 

```no-highlight
Multiple messages in the same stream are not supported.
```

The `AddDeserializer` API can help transition between serializers. See the [Multiple Deserializers Sample](/samples/serializers/multiple-deserializers/) for more information.
