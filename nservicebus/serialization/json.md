include: json-deprecation

This serializer uses [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json) via an [ILMerged](https://github.com/Microsoft/ILMerge) copy of [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json).


## Usage

snippet: JsonSerialization


partial: version


## Customization

Since Json.NET is ILMerged, the Json.NET customization attributes are not supported. However, certain customizations are still supported via standard .NET attributes.


### Excluding members

Members can be exclude using the [IgnoreDataMemberAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.ignoredatamemberattribute.aspx).

The attribute can be used as follows:

```cs
public class Person
{
    public string FamilyName { get; set; }
    public string GivenNames { get; set; }

    [IgnoreDataMember]
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}
```

The serialized output for following instance:

```cs
Person person = new Person
{
    GivenNames = "John",
    FamilyName = "Smith",
    FullName = "John Smith"
};
```

will be:

```json
{"FamilyName":"Smith","GivenNames":"John"}
```


### Customizing encoding

By default, the JSON serializer uses `UTF8` encoding. To customize the encoding, use the following API. In the example below, the custom encoding omits the [Byte Order Mark (BOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark).

## Inferring message type from $type

For integration scenarios where the sender is unable to add message headers, the serializer is able to infer the message type from the [`$type` property supported by Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/SerializeTypeNameHandling.htm). By default Json.NET requires the property to contain the assembly-qualified name of the message type but to make integration easier, the serializer also registers a custom binder that allows only the full type name to be passed.  

See the [native integration with SqlTransport sample](/samples/sqltransport/native-integration) for more details.
