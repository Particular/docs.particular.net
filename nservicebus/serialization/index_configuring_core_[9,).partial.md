## Configuring a serializer

A serializer must be configured using the `endpointConfiguration.UseSerialization` API. Refer to the dedicated documentation pages for each available serializer for more information about the specific configuration.

The same serializer must be used by the sending endpoint to serialize messages and by the receiving endpoint to deserialize them, unless additional deserializers are specified.
