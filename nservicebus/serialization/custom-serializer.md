### Create a custom serializer

A custom serializer needs to implement `IMessageSerializer` interface:

snippet: CustomSerializer

In order to see sample implementations, refer to the [community run serializers](/components#serializers).


### Register the serializer

Register the serializer:

snippet: RegisterCustomSerializer

Note: When using multiple deserializers make sure that there's only one type registered per given `ContentType`.
