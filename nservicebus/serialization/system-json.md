summary: A json serializer using System.Text.Json

The System.Text.Json message serializer uses the JSON serialization built in to .NET to serialize and deserialize messages. This serializer should be the default choice for serialization for new projects.

## Usage

snippet: SystemJsonSerialization

### Specifying content type

The default content type used is `application/json` but can be changed using:

snippet: SystemJsonContentType

WARNING: Adding a suffix like `; systemjson` requires **all** endpoint involved to use this case-sensitive full key. See [NServiceBus.ContentType documentation](/nservicebus/messaging/headers.md#serialization-headers-nservicebus-contenttype) for more information

### Customizing serialization options

To control how the serialization and deserialzation is performed [JsonSerializerOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json.jsonserializeroptions) can be passed in:

snippet: SystemJsonOptions

## Compatibility with Newtonsoft.Json

The System.Text.Json serializer is more limited compared to Newtonsoft.Json, see the [upgrade guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json/migrate-from-newtonsoft) for more details.

If needed, both serializers can be used side-by-side during a transition period by using [multiple deserializers](/nservicebus/serialization/#specifying-additional-deserializers). For this to work, a custom content type needs to be specified as shown above.

## Migration from the community version

Note: Thanks to [Simon Cropp](https://github.com/SimonCropp) who built [the community version of the serializer](https://github.com/NServiceBusExtensions/NServiceBus.Json) and donated it to Particular Software.

The serializer is mostly compatible with the community version, see the [upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/community-system-json.md) for more details.
