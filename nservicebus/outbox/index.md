NServiceBus Version 5 adds the option of running endpoints with similar reliability to DTC while not actually using DTC.


## Enabling the outbox

In order to enable the Outbox for RabbitMQ transport:

snippet: OutboxEnablineInCode

In order to enable the Outbox for SQL Server and MSMQ transports, the following is required:

snippet: OutboxEnablingInAppConfig

NOTE: The double opt-in configuration for transports supporting DTC was introduced to make sure that Outbox is not used in combination with DTC accidentally. The Outbox can be used with DTC only if **all endpoints are [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)**. Otherwise, problems could arise from double-processing messages sent more than once (because of at-least-once guarantee).


## How it works

These feature has been implemented using both the [Outbox pattern](http://gistlabs.com/2014/05/the-outbox/) and the [Deduplication pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication#In-line_deduplication).

When a message is dequeued it is checked for previous processing attempts. If the message has already been processed and all downstream messages are marked as dispatched, the current message is ignored (considered a duplicate). If the downstream messages are not marked as dispatched (they may or may not have been sent), they are re-sent and marked as dispatched. Otherwise (if the message has not yet been processed) the regular handler logic is invoked storing all outgoing message in a durable storage in the same transaction as the users own database changes. Finally, all outgoing downstream messages are sent and marked as dispatched.

Here is a diagram illustrating how it works:

## Caveats

 * Both the business data and deduplication data need to share the same database.
 * The Outbox is bypassed when a message is sent outside of an NServiceBus message handler. This is because there is no mechanism for repeated dispatching of the Outbox messages other than the standard retry logic, which won't be triggered in this case.


## Using Outbox with NHibernate persistence


### SQL Server Transport

SQL Server transport in combination with NHibernate persistence can support *exactly-once* message delivery in two ways:

 * by sharing the database connection, which is enlisted in TransactionScope;
 * by using Outbox.

If Outbox is enabled the messages are stored in the same physical store as saga and user data. The messages are dispatched only after the processing is finished. When NHibernate persistence detects that Outbox is enabled and used together with SQLServer transport, then it automatically stops reusing the transport connection and transaction. All the data access is done within the Outbox ambient transaction. 

From the perspective of a particular endpoint this is *exactly-once* processing because of the deduplication that happens on the incoming queue. From a global point of view this is *at-least-once* since on the wire messages can get duplicated.
 
The latter is discussed in depth in the [Outbox - SQL Transport and NHibernate](/samples/sqltransport-nhpersistence) sample.


### What extra tables does NHibernate Outbox persistence create

To keep track of duplicate messages, the NHibernate implementation of Outbox requires the creation of two additional tables in the database: `OutboxRecord` and `OutboxOperation`.


### How long are the deduplication records kept

The NHibernate implementation by default keeps deduplication records for 7 days and runs the purge every 1 minute.

These default settings can be changed by specifying new defaults in the config file using [TimeStamp strings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee372286.aspx):

## Using Outbox with RavenDB persistence


### What extra documents does RavenDB outbox persistence create

To keep track of duplicate messages, the RavenDB implementation of Outbox creates a special collection of documents called `OutboxRecord`.


### How long are the deduplication records kept

The RavenDB implementation by default keeps deduplication records for 7 days and runs the purge every 1 minute.

These default settings can be changed by specifying new defaults in the settings dictionary:

snippet:OutboxRavendBTimeToKeep

## Configuring outbox

### Cleanup interval

The default purge cleanup interval is every minute. If your endpoint processes a high volume of message per second it might be needed to change this interval to run more frequently.

If your endpoint processes 1,000 message per second the default value would mean that every minute 60,000 outbox records or documents will be deleted. In that case it probably makes more sense to set the interval to every second to delete 1,000 records per second or even more often like every 100 milli seconds to delete on average 100 records at each interval.
