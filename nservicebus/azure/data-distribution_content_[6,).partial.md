Because NServiceBus groups subscribers based on the endpoint name, in data distribution scenario each endpoint instance has to be given different endpoint name. Usually that name consists of the logical name e.g. `WebFrontend` and a suffix which can be either read from a configuration file or obtained from the environment (e.g. Azure role instance ID). To read more about this pattern see the [data distribution sample](/samples/routing/data-distribution/).
