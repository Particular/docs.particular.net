NServiceBus [Publish/Subscribe](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe) mechanism always delivers events to a single instance of each logical subscriber. Sometimes, however, there is a reason for delivering each event to all instances of the subscriber in order to distribute data. While it is usually better to use a dedicated data distribution technology for that purpose (e.g. a distributed caching solution), NServiceBus can also be used in data-distribution mode.
