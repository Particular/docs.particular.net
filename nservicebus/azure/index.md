 * [Shared Hosting in Azure Cloud Services](/samples/azure/shared-host/)


### Self-hosting

 * [Azure App Service](/samples/showcase/cloud-azure/) using WebApps and WebJobs
 * Service Fabric


## Transports

 * [Azure Service Bus Transport](/transports/azure-service-bus/)
 * [Azure Storage Queues](/transports/azure-storage-queues/)


## Persistence

 * [Azure Storage Persistence](/persistence/azure-storage/)
 * [Service Fabric Persistence](/persistence/service-fabric/)


## Cloud native extensions and samples

 * [Azure Blob Storage DataBus](/samples/azure/blob-storage-databus/)
 * [Azure Service Fabric Partition Aware Routing](/samples/azure/azure-service-fabric-routing/)
