NServiceBus helps create distributed .NET systems not only on premises but also in the Microsoft Azure cloud. It provides a variety of capabilities built for Microsoft Azure such as hosting, Azure-specific transports, and persistence.

## Hosting

* [Hosting in Service Fabric](/nservicebus/hosting/service-fabric-hosting/)

## Serverless

* [Azure Functions with Azure Service Bus](/nservicebus/hosting/azure-functions-service-bus/)

## Transports

* [Azure Service Bus Transport](/transports/azure-service-bus/)
* [Azure Storage Queues](/transports/azure-storage-queues/)

## Persistence

* [Azure Table Persistence](/persistence/azure-table/)
* [Service Fabric Persistence](/persistence/service-fabric/)
* [Azure CosmosDB Persistence](/persistence/cosmosdb/)

## Cloud native extensions and samples

* [Azure Blob Storage Data Bus](/samples/databus/blob-storage-databus/)
* [Azure Service Fabric Partition Aware Routing](/samples/azure/azure-service-fabric-routing/)
