NServiceBus helps create distributed .NET systems not only on premises but also in a public cloud environment. That is why it provides a variety of capabilities built for Microsoft Azure, the cloud closest to .NET. This covers hosting, Azure specific transports and persistence.

## Hosting

 * [Hosting in Azure Cloud Services](/nservicebus/hosting/cloud-services-host/)
 * [Shared Hosting in Azure Cloud Services](/samples/azure/shared-host/)

## Transports

 *[Azure Service Bus Transport](/nservicebus/azure-service-bus/)
 * [Azure Storage Queues](/nservicebus/azure-storage-queues/)

## Persistence

 * [Azure Storage Persistence](/nservicebus/azure-storage-persistence/)
 * [Service Fabric Persistence](/nservicebus/service-fabric/)

## Cloud native extensions and samples

 * [Azure Blob Storage DataBus](/samples/azure/blob-storage-databus/)
