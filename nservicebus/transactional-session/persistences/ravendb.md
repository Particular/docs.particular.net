In order to use the TransactionalSession feature with RavenDB persistence, add a reference to the `NServiceBus.RavenDB.TransactionalSession` NuGet package.

## Configuration

To enable the TransactionalSession feature:

snippet: enabling-transactional-session-ravendb

## Opening a session

To open a RavenDB transactional session:

snippet: open-transactional-session-ravendb

### Multi-tenancy support

The specific tenant database name is retrieved from message headers as configured in the [`SetMessageToDatabaseMappingConvention`-method](/persistence/ravendb/#multi-tenant-support).
This header needs to be set in the options so that the necessary information is available when storing operations and interacting with the outbox.

snippet: open-transactional-session-ravendb-multitenant

## Transaction usage

Message and database operations made via the the transactional session are committed together once the session is committed:

snippet: use-transactional-session-raven

See the [RavenDB shared session documentation](/persistence/ravendb/#shared-session) for further details about using the transaction.
