In order to use the TransactionalSession feature with CosmosDB Persistence, add a reference to the `NServiceBus.Persistence.CosmosDB.TransactionalSession` NuGet package.

## Configuration

To enable the TransactionalSession feature:

snippet: enabling-transactional-session-cosmos

## Opening a session

To open a CosmosDB transactional session, a partition key must be provided:

snippet: open-transactional-session-cosmos

### Custom container

By default, the transactional session uses the [configured default container](/persistence/cosmosdb/#usage-customizing-the-container-used). The `CosmosOpenSessionOptions` can be configured with container information to be used for this transaction:

snippet: open-transactional-session-cosmos-container

## Transaction usage

Message and database operations made via the the transactional session are committed together once the session is committed:

snippet: use-transactional-session-cosmos

See the [Cosmos DB persistence transactions documentation](/persistence/cosmosdb/transactions.md#sharing-the-transaction) for further details about using the transaction.
