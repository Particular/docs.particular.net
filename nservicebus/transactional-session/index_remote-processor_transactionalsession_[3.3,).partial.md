## Remote processor

When used together with the [outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) in a [send-only](/nservicebus/hosting/#self-hosting-send-only-hosting) endpoint, the transactional session must be configured with a remote processor endpoint that will manage the outbox on behalf of the send-only endpoint.

snippet: configure-remote-processor

> [!WARNING]
> Both the send-only endpoint and the processor endpoint must be connected to the same database. See [documentation for the individual persisters](/persistence/) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
The processor endpoint [must have both the outbox and the transactional session enabled](/nservicebus/transactional-session/#failure-scenarios-commit-takes-too-long).

> [!NOTE]
> If migrating to this mode from an endpoint couldn't be made send-only due to the previous limitations of the transactional session, see the migration guidance below.

### Benefits

Using the transactional session in send-only endpoints has the following benefits:

- Simplified management: For short-lived endpoints, there is no longer a need to make sure that all control messages have been processed before decommissioning them
- Targeted scaling: Scaling can be tailored with only the load of control messages in mind since the incoming load to store the records are handled by the endpoint using the processor.

### Outbox cleanup

For persisters where [Outbox cleanup](/nservicebus/outbox/#outbox-expiration-duration) is performed by the endpoint instances, only the remote processing endpoint should have the cleanup enabled to prevent concurrent cleanup from happening.

Applies to:

- SQL Persistence
- NHibernate

### Migration to send-only endpoint mode

For endpoints that previously couldn't be send-only because of the transactional session limitations, you can use the following procedure to migrate your endpoint.

#### Preparation

1. Ensure that no message handlers exist in the endpoint
1. Deploy a new processor endpoint
1. Stop the endpoint and ensure that all messages in the input queue are consumed

#### Configuration

1. Make the endpoint send only
1. Configure the endpoint to use the new processor endpoint as shown above
1. Start the endpoint

> [!NOTE]
> The send-only endpoint will now use the outbox of the new processor endpoint. Since [message deduplication is not possible when using the transactional session](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.TransactionalSession/issues/97), no data migration is needed

#### Cleanup

1. Remove the no longer used input queue of the send-only endpoint
1. As needed, remove any database artifacts (tables, documents, etc) related to the send-only endpoint.  See [documentation for the individual persisters](/persistence/) for more details.
