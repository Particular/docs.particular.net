title: NServiceBus and BizTalk
summary: NServiceBus guides you away from dangerous anti-patterns while providing messaging patterns and integration.

BizTalk is a good centralized message broker with many adapters for third party applications, but service buses are inherently distributed, not centralized. Logical centralization leads to spaghetti code.

Mixing logical orchestration and routing with business logic, data access, and web services calls is not a good idea and leads to slow, unmaintainable code.

NServiceBus guides you away from these dangerous anti-patterns while still providing messaging patterns and integration.

## Best of both worlds

In many cases you need to integrate your code with existing systems and legacy applications possibly running on different technologies and proprietary protocols. This is a classical Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) situation and is not what service buses are meant to address.

In these cases, between your high-level business services you can use NServicebus, and within the relevant services, behind the service boundary, you can use BizTalk to perform the integration with your existing systems and legacy applications. Here's how it looks:

As you can see, the use of BizTalk behind a service boundary is something of an implementation/integration detail. By keeping the scope of the problem domain small, using BizTalk for a small orchestration to synchronize customer information between Oracle PeopleSoft and SalesForce won't run into either performance or maintainability problems.

## Next steps

Sometimes you need a hammer, sometimes you need a screwdriver, and sometimes you need both. While a Swiss army knife may appear to do both, it is a poor choice for any but the most trivial undertakings.
