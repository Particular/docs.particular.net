When working with NServiceBus in unobtrusive mode you may feel that you are repeating the conventions over and over again on all the endpoints.

Just define your implementation in an assembly referenced by all the endpoints:

### Version 4

<!-- import UnobtrusiveConventionsV4 -->

### Version 5

<!-- import UnobtrusiveConventionsV5 -->
