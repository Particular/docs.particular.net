### [Azure Storage](/nservicebus/azure-storage-persistence/)

Uses Azure Tables Storage for storage.


### [RavenDB](/nservicebus/ravendb/)

Uses the [RavenDB document database](https://ravendb.net/) for storage.


### [Service Fabric](/nservicebus/service-fabric/)

A persister built on top of [Service Fabric Reliable Collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-reliable-collections).


### [NHibernate](/nservicebus/nhibernate/)
