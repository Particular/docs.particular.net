There are several ways to make sure that your NServiceBus endpoints pick up and use your license. The following options are available: [Registry](#registry), [subfolder in your BIN directory](#subfolder_in_bin), [app.config](#app.config), or [fluent API](#fluent_api).

## Using the registry

NServiceBus supports storing the license in a registry key. This allows you to install a license for the entire server, making it very easy to update. If you are managing many machines this also allows you to automatically roll out changes to all machines using group policies. 

**NServiceBus 4.5 and above**

The registry key where the license is stored is `[HKLM\\Software\\ParticularSoftware\\License]`. You could also choose to install it under `HKCU` instead of `HKLM`. When installing under `HKCU`, please note that it would only be available for the user that is currently logged in. 

In order to install your license in the registry, you can do so in one of the following ways:

- You can simply use the `Regedit.exe` tool and create a `REG_MULTI_SZ` value called `License` under `HKLM\\Software\\ParticularSoftware` and simply paste the contents of the license file you've received from Particular software. 
- Run the following powershell command from an administrative powershell prompt.

```
$content = Get-Content {path to your license file} | Out-String
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\ParticularSoftware -Name License -Force -Value $content
```
NOTE: On a 64 bit operating system this script should not be run through the Powershell(x86) console prompt, doing so will result in the license being imported into the wrong registry key. Please use a 64bit powershell session.  

NOTE: As of version 4.5, both the `LicenseInstaller.exe` tool and the `install-NServiceBusLicense` powershell commandlet has been deprecated. 

**Version 3.3**

NServiceBus V3.3 supports storing the license in a registry key called `[HKEYCURRENTUSER\\Software\\NServiceBus\\{Major.Minor}\\License]`.

To install the license in the registry, use one of these options:

-   The `LicenseInstaller.exe` tool that comes with the NServiceBus install.
-   The [Install-License](managing-nservicebus-using-powershell.md) PowerShell commandlet.
-   If your trial license has expired and you are running in debug mode, the endpoint shows you a dialog that enables you to install the license.

**Version 4.0** 

When installed using the [Install-NServiceBusLicense](managing-nservicebus-using-powershell.md) PowerShell commandlet and the LicenseInstaller.exe tool that comes with the NServiceBus install, in NServiceBus V4.0, the license file was stored under `HKLM\\Software\\NServiceBus\\{Major.Minor}\\License` and in version v4.3, this location was moved to `HKLM\\Software\\ParticularSoftware\\NServiceBus\\License`. 
In order to install the license file under HKCU (same location in version 3.3), please use the `-c` option on the `LicenseInstaller.exe`


## Using a subfolder in your BIN directory

To have NServiceBus automatically pick up your License.xml file, place it in a subfolder named /License under your BIN folder.


## Using the app.config settings

As a developer you can specify the license in app.config:

-   Use the key **NServiceBus/LicensePath** to specify the path where NServiceBus looks for your license. For example:

```XML
<appSettings>
  <add key="NServiceBus/LicensePath" value="C:\NServiceBus\License\License.xml" />
</appSettings>
```
-   Use the key **NServiceBus/License** to transfer the actual HTML-encoded contents of your license. For example:

```XML
<appSettings>
  <add key="NServiceBus/License" value="&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;
license id=&quot;1222e1d1-2222-4a46-b1c6-943c442ca710&quot; expiration=&quot;2013-11-30T00:00:00.0000000
&quot; type=&quot;Standard&quot; LicenseType=&quot;Standard&quot; LicenseVersion=&quot;4.0
&quot; MaxMessageThroughputPerSecond=&quot;Max&quot; WorkerThreads=&quot;Max
&quot; AllowedNumberOfWorkerNodes=&quot;Max&quot;&gt;
. . .
&lt;/license&gt;" />  
</appSettings>
```


## Using the Fluent API

As a developer you can specify the license to use in your configuration code:

### Version 4

<!-- import LicenseV4 -->

### Version 5

<!-- import LicenseV5 -->
