Set up a single static field to a `ILog` in the classes, and then use it in all methods, like this:

snippet: UsingLogging

NOTE: When writing to a logger ensure the log level is of an equivalent value that will result in that log entry being written. So for example when calling `.Debug(..)` ensure that the log level is set to DEBUG. See [Change settings via configuration](/nservicebus/logging/#changing-the-defaults).

NOTE: Since `LogManager.GetLogger(..);` is an expensive call it is important that the field is `static` so that the call only happens once per class and have the best possible performance.
