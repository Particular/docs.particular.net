NServiceBus can write a significant amount of information to the log. To limit this information use the filtering features of the underlying logging framework.

For example to limit log output to a specific namespace.

Here is a code configuration example for adding a [Rule](https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Configuration-file#rules).
