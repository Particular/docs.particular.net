Writing diagnostic log entries to [Serilog](https://serilog.net/). Plugs into the low level [pipeline](/nservicebus/pipeline) to give more detailed diagnostics.


## Usage

It is optional to use Serilog as the main NServiceBus logger. i.e. no need to include `LogManager.Use<SerilogFactory>();`.


#### Create an instance of a Serilog Logger

snippet: SerilogTracingLogger


### Configure the Tracing feature to use that logger

snippet: SerilogTracingPassLoggerToFeature


## Seq

To log to [Seq](https://getseq.net/):
