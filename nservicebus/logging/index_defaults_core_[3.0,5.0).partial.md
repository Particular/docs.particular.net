Logging is only enabled in the NServiceBus Host. For self hosting [enable the logging using code](log4net.md).

See [NServiceBus Host Profiles](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/profiles.md) for the default logging in the NServiceBus Host.


## Changing the defaults

This can be achieved by taking full control over the [Log4Net integration](log4net.md).
