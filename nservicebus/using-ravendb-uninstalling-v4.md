As of October 15, 2014 the Platform Installer no longer installs RavenDB v2.0 in a folder called "NServiceBus.Persistence.v4" under `Program Files` as a prerequisite since NServiceBus V5 no longer uses it as the default persistence - [see this document](using-ravendb-in-nservicebus-installing.md). If you previously installed this and want to remove it either because you don't need it or you wish to install RavenDB version v2.5 (required version for NServiceBus V5), then you will need to manually remove it.

## Manual Removal Instructions

1. Run "Raven.Server.exe  /uninstall"  to unregister the service. This doesn't remove the directory, which is by design as the data sub-directory contains any databases you've created.  See [this document](http://ravendb.net/docs/server/deployment/as-a-service).

2. Remove the registry key "RavenPort" under "HKLM\SOFTWARE\ParticularSoftware\ServiceBus"

3. Remove URLACL for RavenDB Port - it will correspond to the RavenPort listed above, it can also be found in the Raven.Server.config

### URLACL Removal

To list the URACLs for that port, from an **Admin** PowerShell run:

`netsh.exe http show urlacl | select-string :8080`

This may return something like the following:

`Reserved URL            : http://+:8080/`

You can remove it with this command:

`netsh.exe http delete urlacl url=http://+:8080/` 

### Final Folder Cleanup

Remove the folder and sub-folder (assuming you are fine with deleting the RavenDB databases).   

There is one additional cleanup step if you used the PlatformInstaller to install it. The Platform Installer used Chocolatey behind the scenes to install packages. It  keeps a copy of the install in a sub-folder.

The following powershell command will list the directory which you can safely delete.  

`dir ("{0}\lib" -f $env:ChocolateyInstall) -Filter *RavenDB* | Select -ExpandProperty FullName`
