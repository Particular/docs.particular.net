All releases are [announced on the Particular Software discussion forum](https://discuss.particular.net/c/announcements).

## Notifications

There are two ways to be notified of new releases of packages and software from Particular Software:

1) Register on the [Particular forum](https://discuss.particular.net) and ensure that notifications are set to "Watching" on the announcement channel to receive announcements for all platform components.
1) Register at [GitHub](https://github.com/) and browse to repositories under the [Particular organization](https://github.com/Particular) that should be monitored. Expand the repository watch options and enable notifications for releases you are interested in.

## Atom Feeds

Feeds are useful to receive updates on releases via other channels and can be integrated into other workflows with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

There are several feeds available:

- Discussion forum: All announcements on the forum: <https://discuss.particular.net/c/announcements.rss>
- GitHub: All repositories on Github have an Atom feed on the release pages for each package. For example: <https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/releases.atom>
- NuGet: All NuGet packages have an Atom feed. For example: <https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus/atom.xml>
