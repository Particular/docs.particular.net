All releases are [announced on the discussion forum](https://discuss.particular.net/c/announcements).

## Notifications

Register on the [Particular forum](https://discuss.particular.net) and ensure that notifications are set to "Watching" on the announcement channel to receive announcements for all platform components or register at [GitHub](https://github.com/) and browse to specific repositories and expand the repository watch options (upper right) and ensure that atleast notifications are enabled for releases to receive notifications for specific packages.

## Atom Feeds

Feeds are useful to receive updates on releases via other channels and useful to integration with platforms like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).
