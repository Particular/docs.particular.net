The distributed nature of parallel message-driven systems makes them more difficult to debug than their sequential, synchronous, and centralized counterparts. For these reasons, NServiceBus provides built-in message auditing for every endpoint. Just tell NServiceBus that you want auditing and it will capture a copy of every received message and forward it to a specified audit queue. 

It is recommended that you specify a central auditing queue for all related endpoints (i.e. endpoints that belong to the same system). By doing so you can take advantage of central auditing within a distributed system. This is also required by the Particular Service Platform and especially [ServiceControl](/servicecontrol), which consumes messages from these auditing queues. For more information, see [ServicePulse documentation](/servicepulse/).

## Configuring auditing

### Version 3

Add the attribute `ForwardReceivedMessagesTo` to the `UnicastBusConfig` section of an endpoint's configuration file, as shown:

<!-- import configureAuditV3 -->

NOTE: In version 3.X use the `ForwardReceivedMessageTo` Attribute

### Version 4 and Version 5

Add the `AuditConfig` section to the configuration file, as shown:

<!-- import configureAuditV4 -->

Versions after 3 also supports setting up the error queue and the audit queue at the machine level in the registry. Use the [Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings](managing-nservicebus-using-powershell.md) PowerShell commandlet to set these values at a machine level. When set at machine level, the setting is not required in the endpoint configuration file for messages to be forwarded to the audit queue.

N.B. For backwards compatibility, V4 still supports the attribute `ForwardReceivedMessagesTo` on `UnicastBusConfig` section, but you will receive a warning recommending that you upgrade your configuration to use `AuditConfig` section.

## Handling Audit messages

NServiceBus then forwards all messages arriving at the given endpoint to the queue called `AuditQueue` on the machine called `AdminMachine`. You can specify any queue on any machine, although only one is supported.

What you choose to do with those messages is now up to you: save them in a database, do custom logging, etc. The important thing is that you now have a centralized record of everything that is happening in your system while maintaining all the benefits of keep things distributed.

## Turning off auditing

If the auditing settings are in `app.config`, remove them or comment them out.

If the machine level auditing is turned on, clear the value for the string value `AuditQueue` under

    HKEYLOCALMACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\ParticularSoftware\\ServiceBus

If running 64 bit, in addition to the above, also clear the value for `AuditQueue` under 

    HKEYLOCALMACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\ParticularSoftware\\ServiceBus

## Message headers

Custom headers are attached to each message. You can examine them in the audit queue using a third-party tool for MSMQ.
