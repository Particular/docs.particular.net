The SQL Persistence uses [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) to serialize data and store in a SQL database.


## Supported SQL Implementations

 * [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/) ([Version 2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/release-notes/sql-server-2012-release-notes) and above due to the use of the [THROW functionality](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee677615.aspx)).
 * [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) ([Version 5.7](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/) and above due to the use of [JSON Data Type](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html)).

WARNING: Although this persistence will run on the free version of the above engines, i.e. [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express) and [MySQL Community Edition](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/), it is strongly recommended to use commercial versions for any production system. It is also recommended to ensure that support agreements are in place from either [MySQL support](https://www.mysql.com/support/), [Microsoft Premier Support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftservices/support.aspx) or another third party support provider.


## Usage

Install the [NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql/) and [NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.MsBuild](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.MsBuild/) NuGet packages.


### SQL Server

### MySQL

Using the [MySql.Data NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data/).

snippet:SqlPersistenceUsageMySql

The following settings are required for [MySQL connections string](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-connection-options.html).

 * `AllowUserVariables=True`: since the Persistence uses [user variables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/user-variables.html).
 * `AutoEnlist=false`: To prevent auto enlistment in a [Distributed Transaction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681205.aspx) which the MySql .net connector does not currently support.


## NuGets Packages

The SQL Persistence consists of several NuGet Packages.


### [NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.MsBuild](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.MsBuild/)

This packages installs into the MSBuild pipeline and generates all SQL installation scripts at compile time.
 It is required for any project where those SQL installation scripts are required. For Saga Scripts it will be any project that contains Saga classes. For Timeouts, Subscriptions and Outbox Scripts it will be the endpoint hosting project.


### [NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql/)

This package contains several parts

 * APIs for manipulating `EndPointConfiguration` at configuration time.
 * Runtime implementations of Saga, Timeouts, Subscriptions and Outbox Persister
 * Attribute definitions used to define certain compile time configuration settings. These attributes are then interrogated by the NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.MsBuild NuGet Package when generating SQL installation scripts


### [NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.ScriptBuilder](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.ScriptBuilder/)

This package contains all APIs that enable the generation of SQL installation scripts using code, i.e. without using the NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.MsBuild NuGet package.

DANGER: NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.ScriptBuilder is currently not ready for general usage. It has been made public, and deployed to NuGet, primarily to enable the generation of documentation in a repeatable way. For example it is used to the SQL scripts in both the [MS SQL Server Scripts](/nservicebus/sql-persistence/sqlserver-scripts.md) and [MySql Scripts](/nservicebus/sql-persistence/mysql-scripts.md) pages. In future releases the API may evolve in ways that do not follow the standard of [Release Policy - Semantic Versioning](/nservicebus/upgrades/release-policy.md#semantic-versioning). Raise an issue in the [NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql Repository](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql/issues) to discuss this in more detail.


## Script Creation

SQL installation scripts are created at compile time by the `NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql.MsBuild` NuGet package.

Scripts will be created in the directory format of `[CurrentProjectDebugDir]\NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql\[SqlVariant]`.

For example for a project named `ClassLibrary` build in Debug mode the following directories will be created.

 * `ClassLibrary\bin\Debug\NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql\MsSqlServer`
 * `ClassLibrary\bin\Debug\NServiceBus.Persistence.Sql\MySql`

Scripts will also be included in the list of project output files. So this means those files produced will be copied to the output directory of any project that references it.

What scripts are created can be controlled via the use of `[SqlPersistenceSettings]` applied to the target assembly.

## Installation

The SQL persistence enables creation of scripts that can be run as a part of a deployment process instead of as part of endpoint startup as with [standard installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md). See [Installer Workflow](installer-workflow.md) for more information.

To streamline development SQL persistence installers are executed at endpoint startup, in the same manner as all other installers. However in higher level environment scenarios, where standard installers are being run, but the SQL persistence installation scripts have been executed as part of a deployment, it may be necessary to explicitly disable the SQL persistence installers executing while leaving standard installers enabled.

### Table Prefix

Table prefix is the string that is prefixed to every table name, i.e. Saga, Outbox, Subscription and Timeout tables.

The default TablePrefix is [Endpoint Name](/nservicebus/endpoints/specify-endpoint-name.md) with all periods (`.`) replaced with underscores (`_`).

A Table Prefix is required at runtime and install time.

When using the default (execute at startup) approach to installation the value configured in code will be used.

snippet: TablePrefix


#### Manual installation

When performing a custom script execution the TablePrefix is required. See also [Installer Workflow](installer-workflow.md).

snippet: ExecuteScripts

Note that `scriptDirectory` can be either the root directory for all scripts for, alternatively, the specific locations for a given storage type i.e. Saga, Outbox, Subscription and Timeout scripts.


## SqlStorageSession

The current [DbConnection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.common.dbconnection.aspx) and [DbTransaction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.common.dbtransaction.aspx) can be accessed via the current context.
