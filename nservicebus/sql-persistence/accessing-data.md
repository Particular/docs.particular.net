SQL persistence supports a mechanism that allows using the same data context used by NServiceBus internals to also store business data. This ensures atomicity of changes done across multiple handlers and sagas involved in processing of the same message. See [accessing data](/nservicebus/handlers/accessing-data.md) to learn more about other ways of accessing the data in the handlers.

The current [DbConnection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.common.dbconnection.aspx) and [DbTransaction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.common.dbtransaction.aspx) can be accessed via the current context.

NOTE: If different connections strings were used for particular persistence features such as sagas, timeouts, etc. then `context.SynchronizedStorageSession.SqlPersistenceSession()` will expose connection for sagas.

Regardless of how the database connection is accessed, it is fully managed by NServiceBus.
