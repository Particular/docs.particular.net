NServiceBus uses defaults that ensure good performance in common cases. While this is usually the preferred mode of operation there are situations where tuning might be desired.

## Tuning concurrency

partial: defaults

Limit maximum concurrency so that no more messages than the specified value are ever being processed at the same time. Set this value to `1` to process messages sequentially. If not specified the transport will choose an optimal value that is a balance between throughput and effective ressource usage.

Examples where concurrency tuning might be relevant are

 * Non thread safe code that needs to run sequentially
 * Databases that might deadlock when getting too many concurrent requests
 
NOTE: The endpoint needs to be restarted for concurrency changes to take effect.
