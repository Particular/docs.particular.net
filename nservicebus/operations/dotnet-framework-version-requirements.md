## Compatibility

NServiceBus targets a specific version of the .NET Framework but that does not mean user code must be targeting the same version. This only indicates the *minimum* required .NET Framework. The actual framework used at runtime is determined by the application.

See [Targeting and running .NET Framework apps for version 4.5 and later](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies#targeting-and-running-net-framework-apps-for-version-45-and-later) and [Version compatibility in the .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/version-compatibility) for more information.
