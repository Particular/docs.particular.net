## Logging

NServiceBus supports logging out of the box. To collect OpenTelemetry-compatible logging in NServiceBus endpoints, it's possible to configure the endpoint to connect traces and logging when using `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` package. See the [_Connecting OpenTelemetry traces and logs_ sample](/samples/open-telemetry/logging) for more details.
