Metrics collects information to measure endpoint health and performance.


## Enabling NServiceBus.Metrics

snippet: Metrics-Enable


## Reporting metrics data

Metrics can be reported to a number of different locations. Each location is updated on a separate interval. If an interval is not specified then the default interval of 30 seconds is used. To change the default interval:

snippet: Metrics-DefaultInterval

### To NServiceBus log

Metrics data can be written to the [NServiceBus Log](/nservicebus/logging/).

snippet: Metrics-Log

NOTE: Metrics will be written to the log at the INFO log level.

### To trace log

Metrics data can be written to [System.Diagnostics.Trace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.trace.aspx).

snippet: Metrics-Tracing

### To ServiceControl

Metrics data can be sent to ServiceControl.

snippet: Metrics-ServiceControl

### To Windows Performance Counters

Some of the data captured by the NServiceBus.Metrics component can be forwarded to Windows Performance Counters. See [Performance Counters](./performance-counters.md) for more information.


## Metrics captured

The NServiceBus.Metrics component captures a number of different metrics about a running endpoint.

### Processing time

Processing time is the time it takes for an endpoint to process a single message.

### Critical time

Critical time is the time between when a message is sent and when it is fully processed. It is a combination of:
- Network send time: The time a message spends on the network before arriving in the destination queue
- Queue wait time: The time a message spends in the destination queue before being picked up and processed
- Processing time: The time it takes for the destination endpoint to process the message

### Messages received performance statistics

These statistics encompass a number of different metrics, including:

- Number of messages pulled from queue
- Number of message processing failures
- Number of messages successfully processed
