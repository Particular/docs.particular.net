Particular provides a PowerShell module to make it easy to setup a computer to run NServiceBus.

The PowerShell module provides cmdlets to assist with:

 * Installing Microsoft Message Queuing Service (MSMQ)
 * Configuring Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC)
 * Installing performance counters for NServiceBus
 * Setting the addresses of the default Error and Audit queues for use by deployed Endpoints
 * Importing a Particular Platform license into the Registry
 * Removing a worker from a [Distributor](/nservicebus/msmq/distributor/)


## Prerequisites

Prior to installation ensure that PowerShell Version 2 or greater is installed.

From Version 5.0 the module is compatible with .NET 2 so there is no longer a requirement to upgrade PowerShell to Version 3.0+ or modify the `PowerShell.exe.config` to force .NET 4 to be used.


## Installation

The installation file for the module can be **[downloaded here](https://github.com/particular/NServiceBus.PowerShell/releases/latest)**.


## Usage

After installation the module can be loaded into a PowerShell session by issuing the following command:

	Import-Module NServiceBus.PowerShell

The installation adds the NServiceBus.PowerShell module location to the `PSModulePath` environment variable. If the module isn't available a restart the Windows session may be required for this change to to take effect.

As most of the cmdlets require elevated privileges the module should be used in a PowerShell session that has been `Run As Administrator`.

## Help

A list of available cmdlet can be found by issuing the following PowerShell command

	Get-Command -Module NServiceBus.PowerShell

Help for each cmdlet incorporated within the module and can be accessed via the standard [PowerShell Get-Help Command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176848.aspx). For example `Get-Help Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings` returns the following information

```no-highlight
NAME
    Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings

SYNOPSIS
    Sets the default Error and Audit queues.

SYNTAX
    Set-NServiceBusLocalMachineSettings [-ErrorQueue <String>] [-AuditQueue <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

DESCRIPTION
    Sets the registry settings for the default audit and error queues.
    These settings can be found in the registry under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ParticularSoftware\ServiceBus".
    On 64 bit operating system the settings are applied to both the 32-bit and 64-bit registry.
```

## Upgrade information


### RavenDB cmdlets

NServiceBus now supports multiple versions of the [RavenDB](/nservicebus/ravendb/version-compatibility.md) client. Previous versions of the PowerShell module included cmdlets to install and test RavenDB V2.0.2375. To avoid confusion these cmdlets were removed in Version 5.0:

```no-highlight
Install-NServiceBusRavenDB
Test-NServiceBusRavenDBInstallation
```

For RavenDB installation instructions review [Installing RavenDB](/nservicebus/ravendb/installation.md)


### Licensing

Version 5 of the PowerShell module includes a commandlet for importing a Particular Platform License. This will work for NServiceBus versions 4. To install a license for versions prior to NServiceBus Version 4.5 then an alternative method should be used. See [License](/nservicebus/licensing/).


## Older versions of NServiceBus PowerShell

The previous version of NServiceBus PowerShell have been deprecated.
