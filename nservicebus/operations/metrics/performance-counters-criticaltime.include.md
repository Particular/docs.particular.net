## Critical Time

**Counter Name:** `Critical Time`

**Added in:** Version 3

Critical Time is the time from a message being sent until successfully processed. This metric is useful for monitoring message Service-level agreement. For example "All orders should be processed within X seconds/minutes/hours". [Define an SLA](/nservicebus/operations/metrics/performance-counters.md) for each endpoint and use the `CriticalTime` counter to ensure it is adhered to.


### Configuration

This counter can be enabled using the following code:

snippet: enable-criticaltime

In the NServiceBus Host this counter is enabled by default.
