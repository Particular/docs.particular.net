Define a maximum value for the number of messages per second that the endpoint will process at any given time. This will help avoiding the endpoint from overloading sensitive resources that it's using like web-services, databases, other endpoints etc. A concrete example could be an integration endpoint calling a web API, like `api.github.com`, that have restrictions on the number or requests per unit of time allowed or if a firewall only allows for example a maximum of 100  connections to be created per second per ip addresse for flood protection.

By default no throughput restrictions will be enforce.
