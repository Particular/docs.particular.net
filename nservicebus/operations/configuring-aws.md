Stale endpoint naming issues may occur when shutting down and restarting the server instance from the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) due to AWS changing the hostname of the instance.

It is possible to turn off this server name change feature using the [EC2Config tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2config-service.html) which is installed on the server instance:

In this tool, uncheck "Set Computer Name" in the General tab and click OK:

For Windows 2016 Server, EC2Config has been replaced by EC2Launch. Review the [EC2Launch documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2launch.html) for instructions on how to change the computer name for EC2 instances on Windows 2016 Server.
