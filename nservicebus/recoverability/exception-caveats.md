NServiceBus cannot guarantee the handling of certain types of exceptions.


## `AccessViolationException`

If an [`AccessViolationException`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.accessviolationexception) is thrown, the endpoint will likely terminate. This is because an `AccessViolationException` thrown by the common language runtime cannot be caught by a `try...catch` block.

While this problem can be mitigated by using [`HandleProcessCorruptedStateExceptionsAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.exceptionservices.handleprocesscorruptedstateexceptionsattribute), Microsoft explicitly recommends not to do this.

> Corrupted process state exceptions are exceptions that indicate that the state of a process has been corrupted.

For more information, see [_Handling Corrupted State Exceptions_](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419661.aspx#id0070035).


## `StackOverflowException`

If a [`StackOverflowException`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.stackoverflowexception) is thrown, the process will terminate because the exception cannot be caught by a `try...catch` block.


## `OutOfMemoryException`

The process may terminate if an [`OutOfMemoryException`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.outofmemoryexception) is thrown. This is because, even though this exception type is handled the same way as all others if the lack of sufficient memory persists, another instance of `OutOfMemoryException` may be thrown while the original exception is being handled.
