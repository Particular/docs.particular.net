Error notifications are available for several events.

 * When a [Immediate Retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#immediate-retries) occurs.
 * When a [Delayed Retry](/nservicebus/recoverability/#delayed-retries) occurs.
 * When a message fails all retries and is forwarded to the error queue.

The following example shows how to be notified every time a message is handled by [recoverability](/nservicebus/recoverability/). While this code writes to the console any other action could be taken, for example sending an email or writing to a monitoring system.

snippet: SubscribeToErrorsNotifications

include: notificationThread

The `Notifications` instance can also be injected via [dependency injection](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/).

partial: reactive


## Unsubscribing

Since notifications are global for the current endpoint it is also important to ensure no longer required subscriptions removed so as to not unnecessarily impact performance.
