The Router can create a bi-directional connection between two NServiceBus transports.

The arrows show the path of messages sent from `Endpoint A` to `Endpoint C` and from `Endpoint D` to `Endpoint B`. Each message is initially sent to the router queue and then forwarded to the destination queue. There is one additional *hop* compared to direct communication between endpoints. The following snippet configures the built-in *static routing protocol* to forward messages between the Router's interfaces.

### Case study: Legacy

When a system is being maintained and developed over an extended period, the original decision about the transport technology, which was sound at the time, might become a burden or even an obstacle, e.g., using MSMQ prohibits hosting on Linux.

Instead of a big bang migration from the old transport to the new, the Router allows for gradual migration. New endpoints added to the system use the new transport and communicate with the legacy part via a router. Over time, the legacy endpoints get decommissioned or migrated to the new transport, and eventually, the Router might even become redundant. However, most systems will retain a legacy part for extended periods, if not forever.

### Case study: Cloud

When a new component of an existing system is being built in the cloud, it will likely use a different transport than the existing on-premises components. This is because cloud-native messaging infrastructures such as Amazon SQS, Azure Storage Queues, or Azure Service Bus are much more cost-effective than self-hosting traditional messaging systems in the cloud.

The transport used on premises is still up to the task, and there is no reason to replace it. The Router allows both parts of the system to use transports optimized for their hosting environment while communicating seamlessly.

### Case study: Atomic update-and-publish

NOTE: The [Transactional Session](/nservicebus/transactional-session) component is specifically designed to solve the atomic update-and-publish scenario. It works with all supported transport and persistence packages.

The business logic of a complex system is often split between a front-end web application and several backend services. That frontend application then needs to store or update some data (e.g., an order) in a database atomically by publishing a message.

Atomic update-and-publish is possible with NServiceBus via distributed transactions, the [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox), or connection/transaction sharing available only in SQL Server transport. The first option might not be feasible due to infrastructure constraints. The second works only in the context of a message handler, so it does not apply to a web application.

In cases where SQL Server transport is not a good option for the whole system, the Router can connect the frontend and the backend parts of the system. The frontend can use the SQL Server transport and take advantage of connection/transaction sharing between update and publish, while the backend is free to use whatever transport best suits the system's needs.

To learn more about this case, see the [atomic update-and-publish sample](/samples/router/update-and-publish).
