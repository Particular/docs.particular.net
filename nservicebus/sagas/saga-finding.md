A saga can handle multiple messages. When NServiceBus receives a message that should be handled by a saga, it uses the [configured mapping information](/nservicebus/sagas/#correlating-messages-to-a-saga) to determine the correct saga instance that should handle the incoming message. In many cases the correlation logic is simple and can be specified using the provided [mapping function](/nservicebus/sagas/#correlating-messages-to-a-saga), which is the recommended default approach. However, if the correlation logic is very complex it might be necessary to define a custom saga finder.


### [NHibernate](/nservicebus/nhibernate/) Saga Finder

### [RavenDB](/nservicebus/ravendb/) Saga Finder

snippet:ravendb-saga-finder

If a saga can't be found return `null`.

include: non-null-task

Many finders may exist for a a given saga or message type. If a saga can't be found and if the saga specifies that it is to be started for that message type, NServiceBus will know that a new saga instance is to be created. The above example uses NServiceBus extension for NHibernate that allows both framework and user code to share the same NHibernate session. Similar extension point exists for RavenDB.

NOTE: When using custom saga finders users are expected to configure any additional indexes needed using the tooling of the selected storage engine.
