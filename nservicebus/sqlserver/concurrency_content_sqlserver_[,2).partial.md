Each endpoint running SQL Server transport spins up a fixed number of threads (controlled by `MaximumConcurrencyLevel` property of `TransportConfig` section) both for each input queue. Each thread runs in a loop, polling the database for messages awaiting processing.

As a consequence, if `MaximumConcurrencyLevel` is set to 10, there are 40 threads running and constantly polling the database (10 threads for the main queue, 10 for each of satellite).
