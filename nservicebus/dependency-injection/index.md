Services and state are managed by _dependency injection (DI)_. NServiceBus automatically registers all its components as well as user-implemented handlers and sagas so that all instancing modes and wiring are done correctly by default and without errors. NServiceBus has a built-in DI container, but it can be replaced by another container.


## Dependency lifecycle

There are three modes of dependency lifecycle.


### Instance per call

A new instance will be returned for each call.

Represented by the enum value `DependencyLifecycle.InstancePerCall`.


#### Registration

snippet: InstancePerCall


#### Delegate registration

snippet: DelegateInstancePerCall


### Instance per unit of work

The instance will be a singleton for the duration of the [unit of work](/nservicebus/pipeline/unit-of-work.md). In practice this means the processing of a single transport message.

Represented by the enum value `DependencyLifecycle.InstancePerUnitOfWork`.


#### Registration

snippet: InstancePerUnitOfWork


#### Delegate registration

snippet: DelegateInstancePerUnitOfWork


### Single instance

The same instance will be returned each time.

Represented by the enum value `DependencyLifecycle.SingleInstance`.

WARNING: `SingleInstance` components that have dependencies that are scoped `InstancePerCall` or `InstancePerUnitOfWork` will still resolve. In effect these dependencies, while not scoped `SingleInstance`, will behave as if they are `SingleInstance` as the instances will exist inside the parent component.


#### Registration

snippet: SingleInstance


#### Delegate registration

snippet: DelegateSingleInstance


#### Register single instance

snippet: RegisterSingleton


## Supported containers

Support for other containers is provided via custom integrations.

 * [Autofac](autofac.md)
 * [CastleWindsor](castlewindsor.md)
 * [Ninject](ninject.md)
 * [SimpleInjector](simpleinjector.md)
 * [Spring](spring.md)
 * [StructureMap](structuremap.md)
 * [Unity](unity.md)
 * [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection](msdependencyinjection.md)


## Using an existing instance

The above pages all have examples of how to pass in an instance. This is useful to make use of the full features and share the behavior with NServiceBus.

## Plugging in

If a specific library is not supported, create a plugin using the `IContainer` abstraction. Once this is created and registered, NServiceBus will use the custom dependency injection to look up its own dependencies.

Create a class that implements 'IContainer':

snippet: CustomContainer


Create a class that implements 'ContainerDefinition' and returns the 'IContainer' implementation:

snippet: CustomContainerDefinition


Then register the `ContainerDefinition` to be used:
