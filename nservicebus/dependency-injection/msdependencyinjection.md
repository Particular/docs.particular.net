NServiceBus can be configured to use [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/) for dependency injection.

### Usage

snippet: msdependencyinjection

If there is the need to share the DI container between NServiceBus and the hosting .NET Core application the following code can be used:

snippet: msdependencyinjectionsharedcontainer

### DependencyLifecycle mapping

[`DependencyLifecycle`](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/#dependency-lifecycle) maps to [`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` service lifetimes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2) as follows:

| `DependencyLifecycle`                                                                                             | `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` service lifetime                                                                                                        |
