NServiceBus can be configured to use [Spring](https://www.springframework.net/) for dependency injection.


### Default usage

snippet: Spring


### Using an existing context

snippet: Spring_Existing


### DependencyLifecycle Mapping

The [NServiceBus dependency lifecycle modes](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/) do not map directly to Spring object scopes. Almost all of the lifecycle modes have been implemented using custom type registrations using a Spring [`GenericApplicationContext`](https://springframework.net/docs/1.1-RC1/sdk/1.1/html/Spring.Core~Spring.Context.Support.GenericApplicationContext.html).
