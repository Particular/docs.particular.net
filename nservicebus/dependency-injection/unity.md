NServiceBus can be configured to use [Unity](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity) for dependency injection.


### Default usage

snippet: Unity


### Existing instance

snippet: Unity_Existing


### DependencyLifecycle mapping

The [DependencyLifecycle](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/#dependency-lifecycle) maps to Unity in the following way.

| DependencyLifecycle                                                                                             | Unity Equivalent                                                                                                        |

### Unity dependency breaking changes

Breaking changes in Unity will be handled as follows:

- Changes that require a change to the `NServiceBus.Unity` API (e.g. changes to `IUnityContainer`) will be released in a new major version of `NServiceBus.Unity`.
- Changes that do not require a change to the `NServiceBus.Unity` API will be released as a patch release to the latest minor version of `NServiceBus.Unity`.
- If Unity releases a new major version, it will be supported in a new minor release of `NServiceBus.Unity`.
