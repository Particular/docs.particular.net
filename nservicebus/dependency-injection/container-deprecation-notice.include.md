WARN: Starting with NServiceBus version 8, the dependency injection container adapter packages are no longer required. NServiceBus directly supports the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` model and third party containers can be integrated using the [externally managed container mode](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/#externally-managed-mode). Visit the [dependency injection upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/dependency-injection.md) for further information.
