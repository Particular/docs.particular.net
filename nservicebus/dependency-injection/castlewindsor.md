NServiceBus can be configured to use [Castle Windsor](https://github.com/castleproject/Windsor) for dependency injection.


## Default usage

snippet: CastleWindsor


## Using an existing container

snippet: CastleWindsor_Existing

### DependencyLifecycle Mapping

[`DependencyLifecycle`](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/) maps to [Castle's `LifestyleType`](https://github.com/castleproject/Windsor/blob/master/docs/lifestyles.md) as follows:


| `DependencyLifecycle`                                                                                             | `LifestyleType`                                                                           |

| [InstancePerUnitOfWork](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/)                    | [Scoped](https://github.com/castleproject/Windsor/blob/master/docs/lifestyles.md#scoped)       |
| [SingleInstance](/nservicebus/dependency-injection/)                                  | [Singleton](https://github.com/castleproject/Windsor/blob/master/docs/lifestyles.md#singleton) |
