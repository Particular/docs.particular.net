There are multiple ways of generating an encryption key. Most implementations rely on a *random* object. All examples mentioned here use a secure cryptographic randomizer.


### PowerShell


#### Base64

snippet: Base64-Powershell


#### Hex

snippet: Hex-Powershell


### C&#35;

The code snippets below can be run from [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) or by copying the following code into a new project and referencing `System.Security`.


#### Base64

snippet: Base64-CSharp


#### Hex

snippet: Hex-CSharp


### OpenSSL

[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is well known for its ability to generate certificates but it can also be used to generate random data.


#### Base64

Generates 32 random bytes (256bits) in a base64 encoded output:

```dos
openssl rand -base64 32
```


#### Plaintext

Generates 32 random characters (256bits):

```dos
openssl rand 32
```

NOTE: Be aware that strings parsed by NServiceBus do not use extended ASCII which limits the key range to 7 bits per character.
