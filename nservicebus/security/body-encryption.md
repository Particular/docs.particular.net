Message encryption leverages the pipeline to encrypt the entire serialized message body.

Note: Data in the message headers is not encrypted.

One way of achieving this is by using a [transport message mutator](/nservicebus/pipeline/message-mutators.md#transport-messages-mutators).

The encrypting mutator must be injected via dependency injection:
