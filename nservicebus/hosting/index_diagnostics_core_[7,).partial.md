To make troubleshooting easier diagnostics is collected during enpoint startup and written to the host output directory.

NOTE: This is usually X but on webapps `app_data` is used instead.

To change the output path use:

snippet: CustomDiagnosticsPath

To take full controll of how diagnostics are written use:

snippet: CustomDiagnosticsWriter.
