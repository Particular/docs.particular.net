As the exception states, NServiceBus was not able to find the endpoint configuration, i.e., an implementation of `IConfigureThisEndoint`.

The exception might be thrown by [NServiceBus.Host.Exe](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/), the NServiceBus generic host.

Following are possible causes for this exception:

 * There is no implementation of `IConfigureThisEndpoint`.
 * The class implementing `IConfigureThisEndpoint` is not public.
 * More than one implementation of `IConfigureThisEndpoint`.
 * NServiceBus.Host.Exe is scanning the folder (and subfolders) from where it is running, and finds more than one assembly implementing `IConfigureThisEndpoint`.
 * In the one Visual Studio solution there are different assemblies referencing different NServiceBus versions, and those assemblies reference each other.

For example, the messages assembly is compiled against an NServiceBus version that is different from the endpoint assembly that references it.
