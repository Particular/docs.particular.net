There are many configuration options for endpoints using [NServiceBus Host](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/). The endpoint configuration specifies levels of logging, subscription and saga storage, etc. 

Profiles enable tailoring endpoints configuration for different environments without recompiling code.

There are two categories of profiles:

 * **Environment profiles** can be used to avoid common configuration errors that occur when manually moving a system between different environments, e.g. from development to production.
 * **Feature profiles** allow to turn on and off NServiceBus features such as performance counters with no code changes.


## Default profiles

NServiceBus out of the box comes with a set of predefined environment and feature profiles. It's also possible to create custom profiles or customize the default profiles, to learn more about those options refer to the [NServiceBus Host Profiles customization](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/profiles-customization.md) article.


## Environment profiles

There are three built-in environment profiles that adjust the behavior of the host to the environment in which the endpoint is running. These profiles can be used to easily switch between different environments during development, testing and deployment.


### Lite profile

Suitable for running on the development machine, possibly inside Visual Studio.

partial: lite


### Integration profile

Suitable for running the endpoint in integration and QA environments.

* [Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) are invoked to make deployment easy to automate.
partial: integration


### Production profile

The default if no explicit profile is defined. This profile sets the endpoint up for production use.

* [Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) are not invoked since the endpoint is probably installed as a Windows Service and does not run with elevated privileges. [Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) only run when [installing the host](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/installation.md) or the code runs inside Visual Studio in Debug mode.
partial: production


## Feature profiles

partial: feature


## Specifying which profiles to run

If the host is run without specifying a profile, NServiceBus defaults to the `Production` profile.

To activate a specific profile, when starting the host pass the full name of the profile in the command line. Type names are case insensitive. Profiles can be combined by separating them with white space.

For example, to run the endpoint with the `Integration` and `PerformanceCounters` profiles:

```dos
.\NServiceBus.Host.exe nservicebus.integration nservicebus.performancecounters
```

When installing the host as a Windows Service, the profiles used during installation are saved and they are used every time the host starts. In order to install the host with the `Production` and `PerformanceCounters` profiles:

```dos
.\NServiceBus.Host.exe /install nservicebus.production nservicebus.performancecounters
```


## Logging

partial: logging


The rolling file logs are written to the `logfile` in the same directory as the executable. The file grows to a maximum size of 1MB, then a new file is created. A maximum of 10 files is kept, then the oldest file is erased. If not specified otherwise, the logging threshold is set to the `Warn` level. To configure the logging threshold see [changing logging level via config file](/nservicebus/logging/#logging-levels-changing-the-logging-level-via-app-config).

Warning: For changes to the configuration to have an effect, the process must be restarted.

Refer to the [Logging configuration](/nservicebus/hosting/nservicebus-host/logging-configuration.md) article to learn about customizing logging configuration.


## Persistence

Note: In Versions 6 and above persistence has to be explicitly configured.

The built-in profiles use the following default persistence settings:

| -              | Lite     | Integration             | Production              |
|:---------------|:---------|:------------------------|:------------------------|
|  Timeout       |In-Memory |RavenDB or as configured |RavenDB or as configured |
|  Subscription  |In-Memory |RavenDB or as configured |RavenDB or as configured |
|  Saga          |In-Memory |RavenDB or as configured |RavenDB or as configured |
|  Gateway       |In-Memory |RavenDB or as configured |RavenDB or as configured |
|  Distributor   |-         |-                        |-                        |

In the Lite profile NServiceBus Host will always use the in-memory persistence. In the Integration and Production profiles, the Host verifies if a specific persistence mechanism is provided, e.g. in the endpoint configuration. If not specified otherwise, then RavenDB persistence will be used by default.
