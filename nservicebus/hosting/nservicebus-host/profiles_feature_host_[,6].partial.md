 * `Master` makes the endpoint a "master node endpoint". This means that it runs the gateway for multi-site interaction, the timeout manager, and the Distributor. It also starts a worker that enlists with the Distributor. It cannot be combined with the worker or distributor profiles.
 * `Worker` makes the current endpoint enlist as a worker with its distributor running on the master node. It cannot be combined with the master or distributor profiles.
 * `Distributor` starts the endpoint as a distributor only. This means that the endpoint does no work and only distributes the load among its enlisted workers. It cannot be combined with the Master and Worker profiles.
 * `PerformanceCounters` turns on the [NServiceBus performance counters](/nservicebus/operations/metrics/performance-counters.md). Performance counters are enabled by default when running in Production profile.
