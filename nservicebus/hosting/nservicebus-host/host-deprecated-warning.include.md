WARNING: For endpoints using NServiceBus version 7 and above, it is no longer recommended to use the NServiceBus Host version 8. Use alternative approaches such as [Generic Host](/nservicebus/hosting/extensions-hosting.md), [NServiceBus Windows Service](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md#nservicebus-windows-service) or [NServiceBus Docker Container](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md#nservicebus-docker-container) instead. The host is still supported for existing endpoints to ease the transition phase to the new hosting models, refer to [the upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/host-7to8.md) for further details.
