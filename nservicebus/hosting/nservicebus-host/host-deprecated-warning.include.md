WARNING: Starting with NServiceBus version 8, the NServiceBus Host is no longer supported. Refer to the [the host upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/host-7to8.md) for further details and alternatives.

NOTE: For endpoints using NServiceBus version 7 and above, it is no longer recommended to use the NServiceBus Host. Use alternative approaches such as [Generic Host](/nservicebus/hosting/extensions-hosting.md), [NServiceBus Windows Service](/nservicebus/hosting/#self-hosting-windows-service-hosting) or [NServiceBus Docker Container](/nservicebus/hosting/#self-hosting-docker-container-hosting) instead.
