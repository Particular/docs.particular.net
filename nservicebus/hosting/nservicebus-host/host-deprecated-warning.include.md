WARNING: For endpoints using NServiceBus version 7 and above, it is no longer recommended to use the NServiceBus Host. Use alternative approaches such as [Generic Host](/nservicebus/hosting/extensions-hosting.md), [NServiceBus Windows Service](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md#nservicebus-windows-service) or [NServiceBus Docker Container](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md#nservicebus-docker-container) instead. With NServiceBus version 8, the NServiceBus Host is no longer supported. Refer to the [the host upgrade guide](/nservicebus/upgrades/host-7to8.md) for further details and alternatives.
