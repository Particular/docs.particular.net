This profile configures all the persistence like sagas, subscriptions, timeouts, etc. to be InMemory which is easy to set up but probably not ideal for production.

Lite also turns the TimeoutManager on by default.

[Installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) are always invoked when running the Lite profile.

Logging is output to the console.
