The machine name is used by various components. For example:

- NServiceBus adds diagnostics headers to every message that is dispatched.
- The MSMQ transport uses the machine name for routing.

__*TODO: replace the next two paragraphs for NServiceBus 8*__

To override the machine name resolution, provide a factory method to `NServiceBus.Support.RuntimeEnvironment.MachineNameAction` when an endpoint is configured.

INFO: Override the `MachineNameAction` **before** creating an NServiceBus endpoint configuration object. If this is not done, messages could be sent that will not contain the right machine name values.

## Fully qualified domain names

A common override is to use the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of a machine for either routing or for identification.

See [how to find the FQDN of local machine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/804700/how-to-find-fqdn-of-local-machine-in-c-net) for a good starting point on how to get the FQDN of the local machine.
