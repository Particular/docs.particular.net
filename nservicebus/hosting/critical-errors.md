For many scenarios NServiceBus has built-in [error and exception management](/nservicebus/errors/), for example [message retrying](/nservicebus/errors/automatic-retries.md), however certain scenarios are not possible to handle in a graceful way. The reason for this is that NServiceBus does not have enough context to make a sensible decision on how to proceed after these error have occurred. Some of these **Critical Errors** include:

 * An Exception occurs when NServiceBus is attempting to move a message to the Error Queue.
 * There are repeated failures in reading information from a required storage.
 * An exception occurs reading from the input queue.
 * In Versions 5 and below when an implementation of `IWantToRunWhenBusStartsAndStops.Start` throws an exception.
 * In Versions 6 and above when an implementation of `FeatureStartupTask.Start` throws an exception.
 * In Versions 6 and above when an implementation of `IWantToRunWhenEndpointStartsAndStops.Start` throws an exception. This interface is only available when using either [NServiceBus.Host](nservicebus-host) or [NServiceBus.Host.AzureCloudService](/nservicebus/hosting/cloud-services-host/).


### Default action handling in NServiceBus

And hence the default behavior that will be taken in any kind of self hosting scenario.

NOTE: In Version 4 and Version 3 the bus stops processing messages but is not disposed. This means sending of messages is allowed but no processing of messages will occur.


### Default action handling in NServiceBus.Host

snippet:DefaultHostCriticalErrorAction

WARNING: It is important to consider the effect these defaults will have on other things hosted in the same process. For example if co-hosting NServiceBus with a web-service or website.


### Logging of critical errors

For Versions 4 and above Critical Errors are logged inside the critical error action. This means that if replacing the Critical Error in these versions ensure to write the log entry.

snippet:DefaultCriticalErrorActionLogging

NOTE: Version 3 does not write a log entry as part of default Critical Error handler. This is done high up the stack in the location where the exception occurs. It is for this reason that the `Exception` instance is not passed to the Critical Error handler. So it is optional to write a log entry when replacing the Critical Error in Version 3.


## Custom handling

NServiceBus allows providing a delegate that overrides the above action. So when a Critical Error occurs the new action will be called instead of the default.

Define a custom handler using the following code.

snippet:DefiningCustomHostErrorHandlingAction


## A possible custom implementation

Next define what action to take when this scenario occurs:

snippet:CustomHostErrorHandlingAction


## When to override the default action

The default action should be overridden whenever that default does not meet the specific hosting requirements. For example

 * If using NServiceBus Host, and wish to take a custom action before the endpoint process is killed.
 * If self hosting the process can be shut down the process via `Environment.FailFast` and re-start the process once the root cause has been diagnosed.

NOTE: If not killing the process and just dispose the bus, be aware that any `Send` operations will result in `ObjectDisposedException` being thrown.


## Raising Critical error

Any code in the endpoint can invoke the Critical Error action.

## ServicePulse and ServiceControl Heartbeat functionality

The [ServicePulse/ServiceControl Heartbeat functionality](/servicepulse/intro-endpoints-heartbeats.md) is configured to start pinging ServiceControl immediately after the bus starts. It only stops when the process exits. So the only way for a Critical Error to result in a Heartbeat failure in ServicePulse/ServiceControl is for the Critical Error to kill the process.
