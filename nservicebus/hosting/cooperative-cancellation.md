Starting with version 8, NServiceBus supports [cooperative cancellation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-cancellation). This enables NServiceBus to participate in graceful shutdown of its host by exposing a [cancellation token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken) to abort potentially long-running operations both outside and inside the message processing pipeline.
