NOTE: Since `Environment.UserInteractive` always returns `true` on .NET Core, `ServiceHelper.IsService()` is used to provide a dual console/service experience, i.e. this process can be executed from the command line or run as a Windows Service. Note that if there is intention to target  .NET Core, then `Environment.UserInteractive` can be used.
