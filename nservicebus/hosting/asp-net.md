NServiceBus easily integrates with [ASP.NET Core](https://asp.net) applications.

## Minimal APIs

ASP.NET 6 introduced a new hosting API with the [ASP.NET minimal APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0). The [NServiceBus.Extensions.Hosting package](/nservicebus/hosting/extensions-hosting.md) is fully compatible with the minimal API's `WebApplication` host:

## Generic Host

Starting with ASP.NET 3, the [NServiceBus Generic Host support](/nservicebus/hosting/extensions-hosting.md) provides easy integration with ASP.NET Core applications:

## Dependency injection

Messages can be sent with NServiceBus using the `IMessageSession` API which is available via the dependency injection container.

## Older ASP.NET Core versions

For web applications using ASP.NET Core 2.x, the [Community.NServiceBus.WebHost](https://github.com/timbussmann/Community.NServiceBus.WebHost) community package provides integration with the legacy WebHost.
