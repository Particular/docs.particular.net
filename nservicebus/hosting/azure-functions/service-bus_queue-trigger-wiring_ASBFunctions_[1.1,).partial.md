Starting from version 1.1, Azure Function trigger for NServiceBus is auto-generated by specifying the logical endpoint name using a custom assembly attribute:

snippet: endpoint-trigger-function-wireup

The attribute will generate the trigger Function required for NServiceBus:

snippet: asb-function-hostbuilder-trigger

Note: An invalid endpoint name will generate `NSBFUNC001` error with the message `Endpoint name is invalid and cannot be used to generate trigger function`.

When the trigger Function needs to be customized, the auto-generated trigger Function generation can be disabled by removing the `NServiceBusEndpointName()` attribute and a customized trigger Function added to the project.
