### Program.cs

The `EndpointConfiguration` for the endpoint is defined in the template using the `.UseNServiceBus(…)` method. The generated code includes `TODO` comments to guide further customization—these should be completed to configure the endpoint appropriately.

Additional methods are available to handle endpoint failures and exceptions. These should be modified as needed to suit the specific behavior of the endpoint.
