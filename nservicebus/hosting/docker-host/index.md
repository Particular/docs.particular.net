Docker containers provide the ability to deploy endpoints in a self-contained manner. To create and host an endpoint in a Docker container, install the [Docker container template](/nservicebus/dotnet-templates.md#nservicebus-docker-container) and create a new project using `dotnet new nsbdockercontainer`. The project that is created will have the required endpoint setup infrastructure in addition to the `Dockerfile` needed to create and deploy a container hosting one endpoint.


## Template overview

The `nsbdockercontainer` template creates a project that contains all of the files necessary to build an endpoint that can be deployed to Docker.


### Host.cs

The endpoint's configuration must be added to the `Start()` method. 

snippet: DockerStartEndpoint

There is also a `Stop()` method that can hold any operations required to gracefully shutdown the endpoint.

snippet: DockerStopEndpoint

There are also methods that handle endpoint failures and exceptions, which can be modified to fit the needs of the endpoint.

### license.xml

Each Docker container must have a `license.xml` file included in it. A placeholder for this file is created when the template is used to create a new endpoint. This file must be replaced with a valid `license.xml` file prior to building the Docker container.

An endpoint running in Docker will look for the `license.xml` file in [the same locations](/nservicebus/licensing/#license-management) as it would in any other hosting situation. By default, a project created using the `nsbdockercontainer` template will put the `license.xml` file in the correct location in a Docker image.


### Dockerfile

This file contains the instructions for compiling the endpoint and creating the Docker image.

The endpoint will be hosted in a container that is based on the `microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime` image. Once built, the container image contains the compiled artifacts of the endpoint project, and will launch that endpoint when the container is run.

To compile the endpoint and create the Docker image, run the following command:

snippet: docker-build

Building the container will compile and publish the endpoint in `Release` mode.

```
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app
```

The compiled endpoint is added to the docker image, the endpoint is configured to start when the container is run, and the container is built.

```
COPY --from=build /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyEndpoint.dll"]
```


### Program.cs

The `Program.cs` file contains the infrastructure required to successfully start an endpoint and gracefully shut it down when the `docker stop` command has been issued.
