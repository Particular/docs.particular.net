### Topology configuration

When nothing else configured the default topology is used. It is possible to override the topology configuration by adding topology options to the Application configuration.

The functions integration looks for either topology options placed into `AzureServiceBus:TopologyOptions` or `AzureServiceBus:MigrationTopologyOptions` for migration scenarios.
