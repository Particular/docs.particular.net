Host NServiceBus endpoints with [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) and [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/) triggers.

include: scheduled-message-scaling-warning

## Basic usage

### Endpoint configuration

NServiceBus can be registered and configured on the host builder using the `UseNServiceBus` extension method in the startup class:

partial: configuration

Any services registered via the `IFunctionsHostBuilder` will be available to message handlers via dependency injection. The startup class must be declared via the `FunctionStartup` attribute: `[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(Startup))]`.

### Azure Function queue trigger for NServiceBus

partial: queue-trigger-wiring

### Dispatching outside a message handler

Triggering a message using HTTP function:

snippet: asb-dispatching-outside-message-handler

## Transport configuration constraints and limitations

The Configuration API exposes NServiceBus transport configuration options via the `configuration.Transport` property to allow customization; however, not all of the options will be applicable to execution within Azure Functions.

Any setting that is related to the configuration of the transport like the concurrency limit are ignored, because in this environment Azure Functions is responsible for managing the flow of messages.

Concurrency related settings are controlled via the Azure Function `host.json` configuration file. See [Concurrency in Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#service-bus) for details.

## Message consistency

partial: message-consistency

## Configuration

`ServiceBusTriggeredEndpointConfiguration` loads certain configuration values from the Azure Function host environment in the following order:

- `IConfiguration` passed in via the constructor
- Environment variables

| Key                      | Value      | Notes     |
|--------------------------|------------|-----------|
| `AzureWebJobsServiceBus` | Connection string for the Azure ServiceBus namespace to connect to | This value is required for `ServiceBusTriggerAttribute`. An alternative key can be passed into the constructor. |
| `ENDPOINT_NAME`          | The name of the NServiceBus endpoint to host | A value can be provided directly to the constructor. |
| `NSERVICEBUS_LICENSE`    | The NServiceBus license | Can also be provided via `serviceBusTriggeredEndpointConfig.EndpointConfiguration.License(...)`. |
| `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME`      | The name of the Azure Function app. Provided when hosting the function in Azure. | Used to set the NServiceBus [host identifier](/nservicebus/hosting/override-hostid.md). Local machine name is used if not set. |

For local development, use `local.settings.json`. In Azure, specify a Function setting using the environment variable as the key.

### Custom diagnostics

[NServiceBus startup diagnostics](/nservicebus/hosting/startup-diagnostics.md) are disabled by default when using Azure Functions. Diagnostics can be written to the logs via the following snippet:

snippet: asb-enable-diagnostics

### Error queue

For recoverability to move the continuously failing messages to the error queue rather than to the Azure Service Bus dead-letter queue, the error queue must be created in advance and configured using the following API:

snippet: asb-configure-error-queue

## Preparing the Azure Service Bus namespace

Function endpoints cannot create their own queues or other infrastructure in the Azure Service Bus namespace.

Use the [`asb-transport` command line (CLI) tool](/transports/azure-service-bus/operational-scripting.md) to provision the entities in the namespace for the Function endpoint.

### Creating the endpoint queue

```txt
asb-transport endpoint create <queue name>
```

See the [full documentation](/transports/azure-service-bus/operational-scripting.md#operational-scripting-asb-transport-endpoint-create) for the `asb-transport endpoint create` command for more details.

WARN: If the `asb-tranport` command-line tool is not used to create the queue, it is recommended to set the `MaxDeliveryCount` setting to the maximum value.

### Subscribing to events

```txt
asb-transport endpoint subscribe <queue name> <eventtype>
```

See the [full documentation](/transports/azure-service-bus/operational-scripting.md#operational-scripting-asb-transport-endpoint-subscribe) for the `asb-transport endpoint subscribe` command for more details.

## Package requirements

`NServiceBus.AzureFunctions.Worker.ServiceBus` requires Visual Studio 2019 and .NET SDK version `5.0.300` or higher. Older versions of the .NET SDK might display the following warning which prevents the trigger definition from being auto-generated:

```txt
CSC : warning CS8032: An instance of analyzer NServiceBus.AzureFunctions.SourceGenerator.TriggerFunctionGenerator cannot be created from NServiceBus.AzureFunctions.SourceGenerator.dll : Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, Version=3.10.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'. The system cannot find the file specified..
