The isolated worker model is a newer hosting option for Azure Functions. Running out-of-process decouples the function code from the Azure Functions runtime. For further information about the isolated worker, refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

## Usage

NServiceBus supports the isolated worker hosting model via the `NServiceBus.AzureFunctions.Worker.ServiceBus` NuGet package. The following configuration enables NServiceBus:

> [!NOTE]
> An Azure function project can only contain a single `NServiceBusTriggerFunction` attribute. A project maps to a single Azure Service Bus queue for which it will process incoming messages.

snippet: asb-function-isolated-configuration

The Azure Service Bus trigger is automatically generated by the `NServiceBusTriggerFunction` attribute which will forward incoming messages to the appropriate message handlers.

Should customization of the Azure Service Bus trigger be required, it can be manually declared instead of relying on the auto-generated trigger. See the article on [custom Azure Functions triggers](/nservicebus/hosting/azure-functions-service-bus/custom-triggers.md) for more information.

### Dispatching outside a message handler

To send/publish messages outside a message handler, inject `IFunctionEndpoint` into custom triggers. This snippet shows an HTTP trigger sending a message via NServiceBus:

### Transactions

Unlike the [in-process hosting model](/nservicebus/hosting/azure-functions-service-bus/in-process/), the isolated worker model does not support using [`TransportTransactionMode.SendsAtomicWithReceive`](/transports/transactions.md#transactions-transport-transaction-sends-atomic-with-receive). [`TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly`](/transports/transactions.md#transactions-transport-transaction-receive-only) is the default option.

### Custom diagnostics

[NServiceBus startup diagnostics](/nservicebus/hosting/startup-diagnostics.md) are disabled by default when using Azure Functions. Diagnostics can be written to the logs via the `LogDiagnostics` option:

snippet: asb-function-isolated-enable-diagnostics

Diagnostics data will be written with logger identification `StartupDiagnostics` with log level *Informational*.

### Error queue

By default, repeatedly failing messages are sent to the `error` queue. The error queue can be configured or disabled completely to let the native Azure Service Bus dead-lettering configuration handle failures:

snippet: asb-function-isolated-configure-error-queue

### Known constraints and limitations

The configuration API exposes NServiceBus transport configuration options via the `configuration.Transport` property to allow customization. However, not all options will be [applicable to execution within Azure Functions](./analyzers.md).

Use the `configuration.Routing` property to configure transport routing.

## Preparing the Azure Service Bus namespace

Function endpoints can create their own queues or other infrastructure in the Azure Service Bus namespace by using the `configuration.AdvancedConfiguration.EnableInstallers()` method.

To manually provision the entities in the namespace for the Function endpoint use the [`asb-transport` command line (CLI) tool](/transports/azure-service-bus/operational-scripting.md).

### Creating the endpoint queue

```cmd
asb-transport endpoint create <queue name>
```

See the [operation scripting documentation](/transports/azure-service-bus/operational-scripting.md#operational-scripting-asb-transport-endpoint-create) for the `asb-transport endpoint create` command for more details.

> [!WARNING]
> If the `asb-transport` command-line tool is not used to create the queue, set the `MaxDeliveryCount` setting to the maximum value.

### Subscribing to events

```cmd
asb-transport endpoint subscribe <queue name> <eventtype>
```

See the [operational scripting documentation](/transports/azure-service-bus/operational-scripting.md#operational-scripting-asb-transport-endpoint-subscribe) for the `asb-transport endpoint subscribe` command for more details.
