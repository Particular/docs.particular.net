## Assembly scanning

The assembly scanner loads assemblies from two locations:

- The `bin` directory of the function application
- The Azure Function runtime directory 

Loading an assembly the second time (for example from a different directory), would cause runtime exceptions. Contact [Particular support](https://particular.net/support) for assistance.
