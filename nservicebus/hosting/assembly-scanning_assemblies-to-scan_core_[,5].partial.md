Further control of scanned assemblies can be configured using an "include list" approach.

Warn: Since many extensions such as transports and persisters in external NuGet packages rely on assembly scanning, accidental exclusion of these assemblies can lead to runtime errors and hard-to-diagnose behaviors.
