### BrokeredMessage body conventions

By default `BrokeredMessage` body is transmitted as a byte array. But for scenarios such as native integration, the body can be stored and retrieved using `Stream`. To specify how the `BrokeredMessage` body is stored and retrieved, override conventions provided by using `BrokeredMessageBodyConversion` class.
