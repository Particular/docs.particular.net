The NServiceBus Scheduler is a lightweight/non-durable API that helps schedule a task that needs to be executed repeatedly based on a specified interval. The scheduling infrastructure leverages the approach of reliable messaging with the NServiceBus core functionality. This allows scheduling to include features such as built in retries and forwarding to the error queue. 


## How the scheduler works

The scheduler holds a list of tasks scheduled in a non-durable in-memory dictionary. In version 4 and lower tasks are scoped per `AppDomain`. In version 5 and higher they are scoped per Bus instance.

When a new scheduled task is created it is given a unique identifier and stored in the endpoint's in-memory dictionary. The identifier for the task is sent in a message to the Timeout Manager, setting the message to be deferred with the specified time interval. When the specified time has elapsed, the Timeouts dispatcher returns the message containing the identifier to the endpoint with the scheduled task identifier. The endpoint then uses that identifier to fetch and invoke the task from its internal list of tasks and executes it.


## Example usage

The difference between the following two examples is that in the latter a name is given for the task. The name can be used for logging.

<!-- import ScheduleTask -->


## When not to use it

- As soon as your task starts to get some branching logic (`if` or `switch` statements) or you start to add business logic, instead of a simple `Bus.Send()` or a `Bus.SendLocal()`, you should consider moving to a [saga](/nservicebus/sagas).
- Often, instead of polling for a certain state using the Scheduler API, you can use an event sending model, where an event is published when the expected state transition occurs, and the necessary action is then taken by an event message handler which is subscribed to it. 
- When you have requirements that are not currently supported by the Scheduler API. For example, scaling out the  tasks, canceling or deleting a scheduled task, doing a side-by-side deployment of a scheduled task as outlined in the following section. 


## Current Limitations

- Since the scheduler is non-durable, if the process restarts, all scheduled tasks (that are created during the endpoint's startup) are recreated and given new identifiers. Tasks scheduled before the restart that arrive at the endpoint queue will not be found although a message will be written to the log as information.  
- Scheduled tasks, once created, cannot be canceled or changed.
- While the task repeat interval can be specified, setting a specific time for the task to run is not supported by the scheduler.
- Each scheduled task will be executed in a new task generated by the Task Parallel Library using `Task.Factory.StartNew(Action)`. This means that by default there will be no transaction scope and that it is up to you to create one if needed.
- Tasks can be run concurrently if a task its execution duration exceeds the schedule interval. If task executions may not overlap then either cancel the old or new task or wait for the current task to complete.
- Since the scheduler uses the queuing mechanism, it does have some side effects on the timelines of scheduled tasks. When a task is scheduled to be run at a given time it is not "executed at that time", it is instead "queued at that time" to be executed. In most cases this distinction will have no noticeable effect on the behavior of the scheduling API. However in high load systems the fact that a scheduled task is added to the back of the queue can result in a noticeable delay between the "time the task has been request to be run" and the "time the task is actually executed".
- The scheduler API does not support scaling out the endpoint or doing a side-by-side deployment of an endpoint. When you have multiple instances of the endpoint that are running on the same machine, while using a non-broker transport such as MSMQ, or when you are scaling out the endpoint instances while using a broker transport such as RabbitMQ, these endpoint instances share the same input queue. Since each endpoint maintains its own created tasks in memory, when the specified time is up and the task is queued at the endpoint, any of the endpoint instances that are currently running can dequeue that message. If an endpoint that did not originally create this task happened to dequeue this message in order to execute it, it will not find the task in its list. 

WARNING: **This will result in the task not being executed but also not being rescheduled.**  


## Converting a scheduled task into a saga

In order to store these tasks in a durable way and support either a scale-out scenario or a side-by-side deployment scenario, you can use a [saga](/nservicebus/sagas) instead. You can think of the scheduler as a never ending saga.

Converting the scheduler code to a saga, with the code for the example usage of the scheduler API shown above:

1. Create a saga for the specified task name that is started by a message. Create a new message if necessary. In this example, the message that starts the saga is `StartMyCustomTaskSaga`. Send this message on startup, using ` Bus.SendLocal(new StartMyCustomTaskSaga{TaskName = "StartupTask1"});`. If you did not use the API with the task name, name your saga appropriately. In this example, the saga is called `MyCustomTaskSaga`. 
2. Create the required saga data and set the task name as a unique identifier for the saga. 
3. Setup the mapping for the saga. This is done so that there will only be one instance of the saga for a specified task name, so as to avoid duplicate tasks being scheduled if the endpoint is restarted.
4. In the `Handle()` method of your startup message, request a timeout. This would be the interval that was specified in the Schedule API. Request the timeout only if it hasn't been requested already to avoid duplicate tasks that can be scheduled if the endpoint is restarted. 
5. Create a timeout class and add the `IHandleTimeouts<T>` in the saga definition.
6. Define the action that needs to occur in the `Timeout` method.

In the following example, the endpoint upon startup will send itself a `StartMyCustomSaga` message to initiate the saga. The saga will request a timeout for 5 minutes if the task hasn't already been scheduled and, in the timeout handler, it will send the `CallLegacySystem` message that will execute some task and also request another timeout for the specified interval.

<!-- import ScheduleTaskSaga -->

NOTE: If you need to cancel a scheduled task, create a new message, e.g. `CancelMyCustomSaga` and modify the above saga to also handle this message, which will end the saga using [MarkAsComplete() method](/nservicebus/sagas/#ending-a-long-running-process).
