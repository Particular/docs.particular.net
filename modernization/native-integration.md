More often than not, legacy system modernization happens in stages, and may end up with a hybrid solution.

This requires communication between the old system and the modern one, where the modifications that can be made to the legacy system are minimal, if any.

NServiceBus enables this communication by providing numerous native integrations with:

- [RabbitMQ](/transports/rabbitmq/native-integration.md)
- [SQLServer and PostgreSQL](/transports/sql/native-integration.md)
- [Azure Storage Queues](/transports/azure-storage-queues/native-integration.md)
- [AmazonSQS](/transports/sqs/native-integration.md)
- [Azure Service Bus](/transports/azure-service-bus/native-integration.md)
