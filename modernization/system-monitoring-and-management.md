Even the best written systems require error handling and stability monitoring to ensure correctness and consistency.

[ServicePulse](/servicepulse/) is a web application designed for administrators. It provides:

- a clear, near real-time, high-level overview of how a system is currently functioning
- common failure recovery operations, such as retrying failed messages
- endpoint health
- real time monitoring
