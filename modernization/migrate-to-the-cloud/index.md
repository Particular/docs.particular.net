Moving on-premises systems to the cloud allows them to benefit from [the advantages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html) offered by  cloud computing.

NServiceBus supports queuing technologies provided by cloud providers like AWS and Azure, so any on-premise NServiceBus endpoints can be migrated to the cloud. The following migration guides provide more details on specific cloud providers:

- [Migrating from on-premises to Microsoft Azure](/modernization/migrate-to-the-cloud/on-premises-to-azure.md)
- [Migrating from on-premises to AWS](/modernization/migrate-to-the-cloud/on-premises-to-aws.md)

## Migrating

By the time an on-premises system is considered for migration to the cloud, it has likely grown large enough that migrating everything at once would be a risky and intensive effort.

To mitigate this, migrating parts of the system to the cloud can be done by identifying, extracting, and moving one piece at a time. New services may also be built during the migration process.

The resulting [hybrid system](/architecture/hybrid-systems.md) requires that on-premises and cloud systems be able to communicate, but allows for a safer and more deliberate migration.

### Hybrid system communication

Queueing technologies do not inherently communicate with each other. As on-premises systems begin moving to the cloud or new services are added, communication from on-premises to cloud technologies becomes essential.

The [NServiceBus Messaging Bridge](/nservicebus/bridge) acts as a connector, allowing on-premises endpoints to exchange messages seamlessly and reliably with those in the cloud.
