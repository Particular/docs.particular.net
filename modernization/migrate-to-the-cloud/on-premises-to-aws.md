## Overview

Something about aws sqs being a cloud offering supported by nservicebus and messaging bridge making it possible to migrate. Can probably sync whatever is here with what goes in the azure page.

The [NServiceBus Messaging Bridge](/nservicebus/bridge) acts as a connector, allowing on premises endpoints to exchange messages seamlessly and reliably with those using the [Amazon SQS Transport](/transports/sqs).
