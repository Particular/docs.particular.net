ServicePulse is a web application designed to provide both administrators and developers with powerful tools for monitoring and managing systems. It offers a clear, near real-time, high-level overview of system functionality, along with common failure recovery operations such as retrying failed messages. Additionally, it provides a rich, graphical view of [detailed performance metrics](/monitoring/metrics/in-servicepulse.md), including insights into logical endpoints, physical instances, and individual message types.

For administrators, ServicePulse simplifies system oversight and is essential for generating [usage reports](/servicepulse/usage.md) to determine licensing requirements. For developers, it offers advanced debugging capabilities, including visualizations of message flows, saga state changes, and other system behaviors. Tools like message flow diagrams and sequence diagrams make it easy to detect anomalies and incorrect behavior. Developers can also access detailed information, such as message headers and metadata, when viewing individual messages.
