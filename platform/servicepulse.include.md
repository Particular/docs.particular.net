ServicePulse is a web application designed for both administrators and developers. 

#### For Administrators

It provides a clear, near real-time, high-level overview of how a system is currently functioning. The UI also provides common failure recovery operations, such as retrying failed messages.

ServicePulse provides a rich, graphical view of [detailed performance metrics](/monitoring/metrics/in-servicepulse.md). These are shown for logical endpoints, physical instances, and individual message types.

ServicePulse is required to generate [usage reports](/servicepulse/usage.md) for determining licensing requirements.

#### For Developers

It provides advanced debugging, visualizations of messages flowing through the system, saga state changes, and more.

Using message flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other visualizations provided by ServicePulse, anomalies and incorrect behavior in a system can be quickly and easily detected. More detailed information, such as message headers and message metadata, is also shown when viewing individual messages.

> [!NOTE]
> ServicePulse developer functionality was previously only available in a product called ServiceInsight
