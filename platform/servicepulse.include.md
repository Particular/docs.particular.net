ServicePulse is a web application aimed mainly at administrators. It gives a clear, near real-time, high-level overview of how a system is functioning.

Notifications will occur when the endpoint is down or when a message fails. [Custom checks](/monitoring/custom-checks/) can be built to get alerts for specific scenarios. The interface supports performing common operations for failure recovery, such as retrying failed messages. In order to display and handle them in a custom way see [subscribe to publicly exposed events](/servicecontrol/contracts.md).
