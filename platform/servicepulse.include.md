ServicePulse is a web application designed for both administrators and developers. 

#### For Administrators

It provides a clear, near real-time, high-level overview of how a system is currently functioning. The UI also provides common failure recovery operations, such as retrying failed messages.

ServicePulse provides a rich, graphical view of [detailed performance metrics](/monitoring/metrics/in-servicepulse.md). These are shown for logical endpoints, physical instances, and even individual message types.

ServicePulse is required to generate [usage reports](/servicepulse/usage.md) for determining licensing requirements

#### For Developers

It provides advanced debugging, visualizations of messages flowing through the system, saga state changes, and more.

It's quicker and easier to spot anomalies and incorrect behavior in a system using message flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other visualizations provided by ServicePulse. More detailed information, such as message headers and message metadata, is also shown.

> [!NOTE]
> ServicePulse developer functionality was previously available in a product called ServiceInsight
