ServicePulse is a web application designed for administrators. It provides a clear, near real-time, high-level overview of how a system is currently functioning. The UI also provides common failure recovery operations, such as retrying failed messages.

ServicePulse provides a rich, graphical view of [detailed performance metrics](/monitoring/metrics/in-servicepulse.md). These are shown for logical endpoints, physical instances, and even individual message types.
