ServiceControl is the backend to ServicePulse and ServiceInsight. It is a background process that collects useful information about an NServiceBus systen. This includes messages that cannot be processed and their exceptions and the ability to collect every message flowing through the system. It can also collect saga state changes, endpoint [heartbeats](/monitoring/heartbeats/), and perform [custom checks](/monitoring/custom-checks/). This information is exposed to [ServicePulse](/servicepulse) and [ServiceInsight](/serviceinsight) via an HTTP API.

ServiceControl can also be configured to collect [detailed performance metrics](/monitoring/metrics/) for display in ServicePulse.
