The [Platform Installer](/platform/installer) handles installing pre-requisites for NServiceBus and the Platform products, such as [ServiceInsight](/serviceinsight), [ServiceMatrix](/servicematrix), [ServicePulse](/servicepulse) and [ServiceControl](/servicepulse).

The Platform Installer depends on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) & Chocolatey packages, and those packages contain the URLs for the installation binaries. For this reason the Platform Installer requires an internet connection and requires access to the Chocolatey repository.
