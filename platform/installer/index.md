### Updating Chocolatey

If you have an older version of chocolatey you can use the [chocolatey update command](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsUpdate#chocolatey-update-cup).

    c:\> chocolatey update

If that fails the recommended approach is to re-install Chocolatey using the following command

    c:\>  @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin
