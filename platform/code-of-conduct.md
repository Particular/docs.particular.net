The Particular community includes all individuals who engage through public platforms such as GitHub, Slack, StackOverflow, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Bluesky, Discuss, and similar spaces.

## Community principles

Creative and effective collaboration is achieved through respect for diverse perspectives and backgrounds. A welcoming and inclusive environment enables open participation and the development of better technical solutions. These spaces are intended for focused, professional discussion about Particular's platform, including products, documentation, architectural guidance, and community contributions.
All participants are expected to engage respectfully and stay on topic.


## Purpose and scope

These public community spaces are intended to:

- Facilitate knowledge-sharing and technical questions related to Particular's platform
- Support discussion of real-world usage and implementation
- Encourage contributions to documentation, samples, and guidance
- Enable constructive technical engagement between contributors and Particular Software

These are not social spaces for unrelated or casual conversation. Contributions should remain relevant to the platform and maintain a professional tone.


## Inclusive participation

Participation is open to individuals of all backgrounds. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or status, age, disability (physical or mental), parental or marital status, political affiliation, socioeconomic background, or physical appearance is not acceptable.

Given the sensitivity of these topics, references to them—if made—must be approached with care and framed respectfully. Advocacy for or against any position or cause unrelated to the community's technical focus is discouraged.


## Unacceptable behavior

Harassment, discrimination, and unethical conduct are not tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Derogatory or offensive comments
- Intimidation, harassment, or personal attacks
- Sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes or remarks
- Off-topic or intentionally disruptive input
- Dismissive or sarcastic replies to genuine contributions
- Use of community platforms for unrelated political, social, or controversial causes

Intent does not override impact. Communication should be thoughtful and respectful.


## Navigating "Hot Topics"

Certain topics may attract heightened attention or strong opinions—for example, comparisons between frameworks, commentary on tooling, or broader industry debates. When participating in such discussions:

- Focus on facts and technical clarity
- Avoid speculation and inflammatory language
- Refrain from speaking on behalf of Particular unless authorized
- Step back if the discussion becomes unproductive or adversarial


## Reporting concerns

Violations of this Code of Conduct may be reported to:
**concerns@particular.net**

All reports are treated with confidentiality and reviewed seriously.


## Consequences

Actions resulting from violations may include:

- Issuing a private warning
- Removing offending content
- Temporarily or permanently restricting participation
- Escalating serious matters to the platform or legal authorities

Particular Software reserves the right to take appropriate measures to protect the integrity and safety of the community.


## Final note

Participation in the Particular community signifies agreement to these standards. By engaging respectfully, focusing on technical collaboration, and maintaining professionalism, each contributor helps shape a community that reflects the values of integrity, inclusion, and excellence that guide Particular Software.
