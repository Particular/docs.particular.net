title: Code of conduct for the Particular community
summary: Guidelines for participating in Particular Software’s public community spaces, including GitHub, Slack, Discuss, and other platforms.
reviewed: 2025-10-30

The Particular community includes everyone who engages with us in public spaces such as GitHub, Slack, StackOverflow, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Bluesky, Discuss, and other similar platforms.

We believe our best work comes from fostering respect for diversity in thought and background. A welcoming and inclusive environment enables us to collaborate openly and build better solutions together. These spaces exist for focused, professional, and technical discussion about Particular's platform - our products, documentation, architectural guidance, and community contributions.
Consistent with our values, all participants are expected to engage respectfully and remain on topic.

## Purpose and scope

These community spaces exist to:

- Share knowledge and ask questions related to Particular's platform
- Discuss real-world usage and implementation scenarios
- Contribute improvements to documentation, samples, or guidance
- Engage constructively with other users, contributors, and Particular staff

These are not social spaces for casual conversation or unrelated topics. Please keep all interactions relevant to the platform and professional in tone.

## We are inclusive

We are committed to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or status, age, disability (physical or mental), parental or marital status, political affiliation, socioeconomic background, or physical appearance.

Because these topics can be sensitive and deeply personal, any mention or discussion of them - if made at all - should be handled with care and framed with the utmost respect. Avoid promoting or detracting from any position or cause.

## What's not tolerated

We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or unethical behavior of any kind.
This includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive or derogatory comments
- Harassment, intimidation, or personal attacks
- Sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes or language
- Off-topic or deliberately disruptive remarks
- Dismissive or sarcastic responses to genuine questions
- The use of these spaces for political, social, or controversial causes unrelated to Particular's mission

Remember that intent does not always match impact - what feels harmless to you may be hurtful to someone else. Choose your words with care.

## Be careful with "Hot Topics"

Occasionally, certain community discussions may "heat up" - for example, comparisons between frameworks, opinions on tooling, or industry‑wide debates. When this happens:

- Keep your comments factual and technically grounded
- Avoid speculation or inflammatory language
- Do not speak on behalf of Particular unless explicitly authorized
- Step back rather than escalate when conversations become unproductive

## Reporting concerns

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it. Speaking up helps maintain a safe and respectful community.

Reports can be sent to:
**concerns@particular.net**

All reports will be treated seriously and confidentially.

## Consequences

Depending on the nature and severity of a violation, actions may include:

- A private warning
- Removal of specific content
- Temporary or permanent removal from the community
- Escalation to respective platform or legal authorities in serious cases

We reserve the right to take appropriate action to protect the health, safety, and quality of our community.

## Final note

By participating in the Particular community, you agree to uphold these standards and help maintain an environment where technical collaboration, mutual respect, and professionalism thrive.
Together, we create a community that reflects the same values of integrity, inclusivity, and excellence that guide the work we do every day.
