### Logging

Instances of the ServiceControl service write diagnostic information and failed message imports to the file system.

NOTE: When ServiceControl is running as a Windows Service critical unhandled exceptions are written to the Windows Event Log.

### Customizing Log Levels

ServiceControl V1.9 introduced a configuration setting to specify the logging level used when writing to the log file.
Refer to [Customizing ServiceControl configuration](creating-config-file.md)) for more details. 

### Location

The location of the ServiceControl logs are controlled via the `ServiceControl/LogPath` configuration setting. Refer to [Customizing ServiceControl configuration](creating-config-file.md)) for more details.

If the ServiceControl configuration file does not this setting the the default logging location is used.
The default logging location is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Particular\ServiceControl\logs`.

The `%LOCALAPPDATA%` defines a user-specific location on disk, so the logging location will be different when the service is configured as a user account. So for example

 * For LocalSystem it will evaluate to `%WINDIR%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Particular\ServiceControl\logs`
 * For a user account it will be `%PROFILEPATH%\AppData\Local\Particular\ServiceControl\logs`

Note: Browsing to `%WINDIR%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Particular\ServiceControl\logs` can be problematic
as the default NTFS permissions on the systemprofile do not allow access. These permissions may need to be modified to gain access to the logs.

NOTE: If multiple Service Control instances are configured on the same machine ensure that the log locations for each instance are unique

 * Edit the configuration file, adding the following setting:
