ServiceControl is a monitoring tool for production environments. As with other production monitoring tools, plan for and maintain the deployment over time.

The primary job of ServiceControl is to collect information on system behavior in production. It does so by collecting error, audit and health messages from dedicated queues. ServiceControl reads the messages flowing into those queues and stores them in its embedded database. In a production environment (and to a lesser degree in development, staging and testing environments), ServiceControl has an impact on the disk space where its data is stored, and its throughput capacity needs to be considered with regard to the overall system load and throughput.


### Storage


#### Location

Each ServiceControl instance stores its data in a [RavenDB embedded](https://ravendb.net/docs/search/3.0/csharp?searchTerm=RavenDB%20embedded) instance. The location of the database has a significant impact on the overall system behavior in terms of performance and throughput. Configure the embedded database files in a high-performance storage device that is connected to the ServiceControl machine with a high-throughput connection.


#### Size

The storage size that ServiceControl requires depend on the production load and is directly related to the quantity and size of messages that flow into the system.

Since ServiceControl is intended to be a "recent-history storage" to support ServicePulse and ServiceInsight monitoring and debugging activity. This is different from a long-term data archiving system, that is intended to provide extremely long term archiving and storage solutions (measured in years, subject to various business or regulatory requirements).

ServiceControl is configured with a default expiration policy that deletes old messages after a predefined time. The expiration policies can be customized to decrease or increase the amount of time data is retained, which impacts the storage requirements of ServiceControl.

To limit the rate at which the database grows, the body of an audit messages can be truncated if it exceeds a configurable threshold.

See also [Automatic Expiration of ServiceControl Data](how-purge-expired-data.md).

**NOTE**

 * The maximum supported size of the RavenDB embedded database is 16TB.
 * Failed messages are *never* expired and are retained indefinitely in the ServiceControl database.


#### Performance

From the perspective of performance ServiceControl can be considered similar to a database installation. It requires a significant amount disk and network IO due to processing of audit, error and monitoring messages. Each of these message processing operations require disk IO. The higher the message throughput of an environment, the higher the required disk IO.

For this reason it is required to store the ServiceControl data on a disk with the lowest possible latency for IO operations. Indexes require continuous updating and will require significant RAM to allow those indexes to be kept in memory. Processing of indexes that cannot be stored fully in RAM will result in a higher likelihood of hose indexes being stale. As all message are added to a full-text search it is also required to make sure that the CPU will not become the bottleneck in updating indexes.

Ensure that:

 * enough RAM is used, 6GB minimum;
 * data is stored on disks suitable for low latency write operations (fiber, solid state drives, raid 10)
 * multiple CPU cores are available
 * infrastructure is monitored (CPU, RAM, disks, network)
 * data is not stored on the same physical system drive
 * storage drive is reserved for ServiceControl

NOTE: To ensure disk performance use a benchmark tool, for example [CrystalDiskMark](http://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskMark/index-e.html). Real disk, CPU, RAM and network performance can be monitored with the Windows Resource Monitor and/or Windows Performance counters.


### Accessing data and audited messages


#### Alternate Audit and Error queues

ServiceControl can be configured to forward any consumed messages into alternate queues. A a copy of any message consumed by ServiceControl is available from these alternate queues.

See also [Forwarding Queues](errorlog-auditlog-behavior.md).


#### Query the ServiceControl HTTP API

This provides a JSON stream of audited and error messages (headers, body, and context) that can be imported into another database.

NOTE: ServiceControl HTTP API is subject to changes and enhancements that may not be fully backward compatible. Use of this HTTP API is discouraged by 3rd parties at this time.


### Throughput

ServiceControl consumes audited, error and control messages in its database. It does so for all the endpoints that are configured to forward these messages to the queues monitored by ServiceControl. This means that the throughput (measured in received and processed messages per second) required by ServiceControl is the aggregate throughput of all the endpoints forwarding messages to its queues.

The throughput of ServiceControl is dependent on multiple factors. Messages size and network bandwidth have significant effect on throughput. Another factor is the transport type used by the system.


#### Transport type

Different transports provide different throughput capabilities.

The transports supported by ServiceControl out-of-the-box (i.e. MSMQ, RabbitMQ, SQL Server and Azure Queues and Azure Service Bus) provide varying throughput numbers, with MSMQ and SQL Server providing the highest throughput numbers.

Azure Queues and Service Bus throughput varies significantly based on deployment options and multiple related variables inherent to cloud deployment scenarios.

It is recommended to plan and perform realistic throughput tests on ServiceControl using the transport of the choice and deployment options that are as close as possible to the planned production deployment.
