> [!NOTE]
> In production environments, make sure to review the [environment considerations](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/hardware.md) when setting up a machine with ServiceControl.

For production systems, it is recommended to limit the number of instances per machine to one of each [type](/servicecontrol/#servicecontrol-instance-types). The ability to add multiple instances *of the same type on a single machine* is primarily intended to assist development and test environments.

See [ServiceControl Capacity Planning](/servicecontrol/capacity-and-planning.md) and [Hardware Considerations](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/hardware.md) for more guidance.
