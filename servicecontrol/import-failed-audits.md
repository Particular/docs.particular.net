title: Import failed audit messages
summary: How to attempt to re-import audit messages that failed to be processed

Audit messages can fail to be imported into ServiceControl database due to one of two reasons:
 * Messages themselves are malformed (e.g. missing headers). This happens e.g. when an outdated version of NServiceBus that contained a bug was used to process the messages.
 * Messages are well-formed but there was an intermittent infrastructure problem (e.g. disk drive) lasting long enough that the processing retries did not resolve the problem

When that happens the periodic **Audit Message Ingestion** custom check is marked as failed to bring the administrator's attention.

To resolve the problem ServiceControl needs to be shut down and started from a command line with `--import-failed-audits` option. In this mode ServiceControl will not process the incoming failed or audit messages but will instead attempt to re-process all the audit messages that previously failed.

If a message is re-processed successfully, the failed audit document is removed. If the message fails processing it usually means that the message is malformed and ServiceControl won't be able to ingest it. Such a message won't be available via ServiceInsight.

To review the malformed messages start service control in [maintenance mode](/servicecontrol/use-ravendb-studio.md) and inspect the `FailedAuditImports` collection. This collection can be modified in order to resolve the data problems that are causing the import to fail. Once the data has been fixed, the messages can be reimported by running ServiceControl from the command line with the `--import-failed-audits` option again.
