When using ServiceControl Management to [create a new ServiceControl instance](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/deployment/scmu.md), a connected ServiceControl Audit instance is automatically created by default.

If necessary, a new Audit instance can be created by clicking **New** > **Add ServiceControl and Audit Instances**, and then unchecking the **ServiceControl** checkbox, leaving only **ServiceControl Audit** checked.
