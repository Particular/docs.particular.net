The configuration of a ServiceControl Audit instance can be adjusted via the ServiceControl Management utility or by directly modifying the `ServiceControl.Audit.exe.config` file. The settings listed are applicable to the `appSettings` section of the configuration file unless otherwise specified.


## Host settings

Anyone who can access the ServiceControl Audit instance URL has complete access to the audit data stored by the ServiceControl Audit instance. This is why the default is to only respond to `localhost`. Consider carefully the implications of exposing a ServiceControl Audit instance via a custom or wildcard URI.

WARN: Changing the host name or port number of an existing ServiceControl Audit instance will break the link from the primary ServiceControl instance. See [Moving a remote instance](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/remotes.md) for guidelines on changing these settings.


#### ServiceControl.Audit/HostName

The hostname to bind the embedded HTTP server to; modify this setting to bind to a specific hostname, eg. `sc.mydomain.com`.

Type: string

Default: `localhost`


#### ServiceControl.Audit/Port

The port to bind the embedded HTTP server.

Type: int


#### ServiceControl.Audit/DatabaseMaintenancePort

The port to bind the RavenDB when in [maintenance mode](/servicecontrol/audit-instances/maintenance-mode.md).

Type: int


#### ServiceControl.Audit/DbPath

The path where the internal RavenDB is located.

Type: string


#### Raven/IndexStoragePath

The path for the indexes on disk.

Type: string

Default: `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Particular\ServiceControl\<instance_name>\DB\indexes`

#### Raven/Esent/LogsPath

The path for the Esent logs on disk.

Type: string

Default: `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Particular\ServiceControl\<instance_name>\DB\Logs`

#### ServiceControl.Audit/LogPath

The path for the ServiceControl logs.

Type: string

Default: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Particular\ServiceControl.Audit\logs`

Note: %LOCALAPPDATA% is a user-specific environment variable.


#### ServiceControl.Audit/LogLevel

Controls the LogLevel of the ServiceControl logs.

Type: string

Default: `Warn`

Valid settings are: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, `Fatal`, `Off`.

This setting will default to `Warn` if an invalid value is assigned.


#### ServiceControl.Audit/RavenDBLogLevel

Controls the LogLevel of the RavenDB logs.

Type: string

Default: `Warn`

Valid settings are: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, `Fatal`, `Off`.

This setting will default to `Warn` if an invalid value is assigned.


## Data retention


#### ServiceControl.Audit/ExpirationProcessTimerInSeconds

The number of seconds to wait between checking for expired messages.

Type: int

Default: `600` (10 minutes). The default for ServiceControl version 1.3 and below is `60` (1 minute), Starting in version 1.4, the default is `600` (10 minutes). Setting the value to `0` will disable the expiration process. This is not recommended and it is only provided for fault finding. Valid range is `0` to `10800` (3 Hours).


#### ServiceControl.Audit/ExpirationProcessBatchSize

The minimum allowed value for this setting is `10240`; there is no hard-coded maximum as this is dependent on system performance.

Type: int

Default: `65512`.


#### ServiceControl.Audit/AuditRetentionPeriod

The period to keep an audit message before it is deleted.

Type: timespan

Valid range for this setting is from 1 hour to 364 days.


## Performance tuning


#### ServiceControl.Audit/MaxBodySizeToStore

This setting specifies the upper limit on body size to be configured.

Type: int

Default: `102400` (100Kb)


#### ServiceControl.Audit/HttpDefaultConnectionLimit

The maximum number of concurrent connections allowed by ServiceControl. When working with transports that operate over HTTP, the number of concurrent connections can be increased to meet transport concurrency settings.

Type: string

Default: `100`


## Transport

#### ServiceControl.Audit/TransportType

The transport type to run ServiceControl with.

Type: string

Default: `ServiceControl.Transports.Msmq.MsmqTransportCustomization, ServiceControl.Transports.Msmq`


#### NServiceBus/Transport

The connection string for the transport. This setting should be placed in the `connectionStrings` section of the configuration file.

Type: string

#### ServiceBus/AuditQueue

The audit queue name.

Type: string

Default: `audit`

#### ServiceBus/AuditLogQueue

The audit queue name to use for forwarding audit messages. This works only if `ServiceControl.Audit/ForwardAuditMessages` is true.

Type: string

Default: `<AuditQueue>.log`

NOTE: Changing the configuration file directly will not result in the queue being created. Use ServiceControl Management to add or alter the forwarding queue. 

#### ServiceControl.Audit/ForwardAuditMessages

Use this setting to configure whether processed audit messages are forwarded to another queue or not. This queue is known as the Audit Forwarding Queue.

Type: bool `true` or `false`

Default: `false`.

#### ServiceControl.Audit/ServiceControlQueueAddress

The ServiceControl queue name to use for plugin messages (e.g. Heartbeats, Custom Checks, Saga Audit, etc ).

Type: string

## Troubleshooting

#### ServiceControl.Audit/ExposeRavenDB

ServiceControl Audit stores its data in a RavenDB embedded instance. By default, the RavenDB instance is accessible only by the ServiceControl Audit service. If, during troubleshooting, direct access to the RavenDB instance is required while ServiceControl Audit is running, ServiceControl Audit can be configured to expose the RavenDB studio. 

NOTE: [Maintenance mode](/servicecontrol/audit-instances/maintenance-mode.md) is the recommended way to review documents in the embedded RavenDB instance.

WARNING: The ServiceControl RavenDB embedded instance is used exclusively by ServiceControl Audit and is not intended for external manipulation or modifications.

Type: bool

Default: `false`

After restarting the ServiceControl Audit service, access the RavenDB studio locally at the following endpoint:

```no-highlight
http://localhost:{selected RavenDB port}/studio/index.html#databases/documents?&database=%3Csystem%3E
```

NOTE: The ServiceControl Audit embedded RavenDB studio can be accessed from localhost regardless of the hostname customization setting. To allow external access, the hostname must be [set to a fully qualified domain name](/servicecontrol/setting-custom-hostname.md).


#### ServiceControl.Audit/DataSpaceRemainingThreshold

The percentage threshold for the [Message database storage space](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/#self-monitoring-via-custom-checks-message-database-storage-space) check. If the remaining hard drive space drops below this threshold (as a percentage of the total space on the drive) then the check will fail, alerting the user.

Type: int

Default: 20
