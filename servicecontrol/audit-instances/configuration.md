The configuration of a ServiceControl Audit instance is controlled by the `ServiceControl.Audit.exe.config` file or by setting environment variables. When a setting configuration exists as both an environment variable and in the application configuration file the environment variable setting takes precedence.

Deployments using the ServiceControl Management utility (SCMU) can use that application to make a subset of configuration settings which are read from and written to the application configuration file.

>[!NOTE]
>Configuration settings in the application configuration file are applicable to the `appSettings` section unless otherwise specified.

## Host settings

The following documents should be reviewed prior to modifying configuration settings:

* [Setting a Custom Hostname](/servicecontrol/setting-custom-hostname.md) for guidance and details.
* [Securing ServiceControl](/servicecontrol/securing-servicecontrol.md) for an overview of the security implications of changing the configuration.

> [!WARNING]
> Changing the host name or port number of an existing ServiceControl Audit instance will break the link from the ServiceControl Error instance. See [Moving a remote instance](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/remotes.md) for guidelines on changing these settings.

## Performance tuning

### ServiceControl.Audit/MaxBodySizeToStore

This setting specifies the upper limit on body size, in bytes, to be configured.

| Context | Name |
| --- | --- |
| **Environment variable** | `SERVICECONTROL_AUDIT_MAXBODYSIZETOSTORE` |
| **App config key** | `ServiceControl.Audit/MaxBodySizeToStore` |
| **SCMU field** | N/A |

| Type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| int | `102400` (100Kb) |

### ServiceControl.Audit/MaximumConcurrencyLevel

The maximum number of messages that can be concurrently pulled from the message transport.

It is important that the maximum concurrency level be incremented only if there are no verified bottlenecks in CPU, RAM, network I/O, storage I/O, and storage index lag. Higher numbers can result in faster audit message ingestion, but also consume more server resources, and can increase costs in the case of cloud transports that have associated per-operation costs. In some cases, the ingestion rate can be too high and the underlying database cannot keep up with indexing the new messages. In this case, consider lowering the maximum concurrency level to a value that still allows a suitable ingestion rate while easing the pressure on the database.

Cloud transports with higher latency can benefit from higher concurrency values, but costs can increase as well. Local transports using fast local SSD drives and low latency do not benefit as much.

| Context | Name |
| --- | --- |
| **Environment variable** | `SERVICECONTROL_AUDIT_MAXIMUMCONCURRENCYLEVEL` |
| **App config key** | `ServiceControl.Audit/MaximumConcurrencyLevel` |
| **SCMU field** | N/A |

| Type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| int | `32` in 4.12.0<br/>`10` in earlier versions |

| **Environment variable** | `SERVICECONTROL_AUDIT_ENABLEFULLTEXTSEARCHONBODIES` |
| **App config key** | `ServiceControl.Audit/EnableFullTextSearchOnBodies` |
| **SCMU field** | N/A |

| Type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| bool | `true` |

> [!NOTE]
> If the audit instance uses RavenDB 5 persistence (available starting 4.26.0), changing the full-text search setting will cause indexes to be redeployed and rebuilt. Depending on the number of documents stored, this operation might take a long time and search results won't be available until completed.

#if-version [5,)

The ServiceControl queue name to use for plugin messages (e.g. Heartbeats, Custom Checks, Saga Audit, etc ).

| Context | Name |
| --- | --- |

## Troubleshooting

ServiceControl Audit stores its data in a RavenDB embedded instance. If direct access to the RavenDB instance is required for troubleshooting while ServiceControl Audit is running, see [Accessing the database](/servicecontrol/ravendb/accessing-database.md).

### RavenDB 5

For instances running version 4.26 and above, which are configured to use [the new RavenDB 5 persistence](/servicecontrol/migrations/new-persistence.md) browse to:

```no-highlight
http://localhost:{configured ServiceControl instance maintenance port}
```

to access the internal database via [the RavenDB studio interface](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/5.4/csharp/studio/overview).


#### ServiceControl.Audit/DataSpaceRemainingThreshold

The percentage threshold for the [Message database storage space](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/#notifications-health-monitoring-message-database-storage-space) check. If the remaining hard drive space drops below this threshold (as a percentage of the total space on the drive) then the check will fail, alerting the user.

| --- | --- |
| int | `20` |

#### ServiceControl.Audit/MinimumStorageLeftRequiredForIngestion

The percentage threshold for the [Critical message database storage space](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/#notifications-health-monitoring-message-database-storage-space) check. If the remaining hard drive space drops below this threshold (as a percentage of the total space on the drive), then the check will fail, alerting the user. The message ingestion will also be stopped to prevent data loss. Message ingestion will resume once more disk space is made available.

| Type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| int | `5` |
