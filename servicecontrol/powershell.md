## ServiceControl PowerShell

ServiceControl version 1.7 introduced a new graphical management utility to add, remove, update and delete instances of the ServiceControl service. These actions and some additional tools are also available via a PowerShell module called `ServiceControlMgmt`.


## Prerequisites

The ServiceControlMgmt module requires:

 * Microsoft PowerShell 3.0


## Loading and running the PowerShell module

The majority of the ServiceControlMgmt PowerShell module cmdlets will only work if the PowerShell session is running with administrator privileges. The ServiceControl installer creates a shortcut in the Windows start menu to launch an administrative PowerShell Session with the module automatically loaded. Alternatively, the module can be loaded directly into an an existing PowerShell session by loading `ServiceControlMgmt.psd1` using the `Import-Module` cmdlet as show below:

```ps
Import-Module "C:\Program Files (x86)\Particular Software\ServiceControl Management\ServiceControlMgmt.psd1"
```


## General Cmdlets and Aliases

The following general cmdlets and aliases are provided by the ServiceControl Management PowerShell module.

| Alias                  | Cmdlet                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| sc-addlicense          | Import-ServiceControlLicense                  |
| sc-findlicense         | Get-ServiceControlLicense                     |
| sc-help                | Get-ServiceControlMgmtCommands                |
| urlacl-add             | Add-UrlAcl                                    |
| urlacl-delete          | Remove-UrlAcl                                 |
| urlacl-list            | Get-UrlAcls                                   |
| port-check             | Test-IfPortIsAvailable                        |
| user-sid               | Get-SecurityIdentifier                        |

### Help

All of the cmdlets have local help which can be accessed with the standard PowerShell help command

```ps
Get-Help Get-ServiceControlLicense
```


### Licensing

Add the license file to the registry:

```ps
Import-ServiceControlLicense <License-File>
```

The license file is added to the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` registry hive so it is available to all instances of ServiceControl installed on the machine.


## Troubleshooting via PowerShell

The ServiceControl Management PowerShell module offers some cmdlets to assist with troubleshooting the installation of ServiceControl instances.


### Check if a port is already in use

Before adding an instance of ServiceControl test if the port to use is currently in use.

```ps
Test-IfPortIsAvailable -Port 33333
```

This example shows the available ports out of a range of ports

```ps
33330..33339 | Test-IfPortIsAvailable | ? Available
```


### Checking and manipulating UrlAcls

The Window HTTPServer API is used by underlying components in ServiceControl. This API uses a permissions system to limit what accounts can add a HTTP listener to a specific URI. The standard mechanism for viewing and manipulating these ports is with the [netsh.exe](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Cc725882.aspx) command line tool.

For example `netsh.exe http show urlacl` will list all of the available UrlAcls. This output is detailed but not easy to query. The ServiceControl Management PowerShell provides simplified PowerShell equivalents for listing, adding, and removing UrlAcls and makes the output easier to query.

For example the following command lists all of the UrlAcls assigned to any URI for port 33333.

```ps
Get-UrlAcls | ? Port -eq 33333
```

In this example any UrlAcl on port 33335 is remove

```ps
Get-UrlAcls | ? Port -eq 33335 | Remove-UrlAcl
```

The following example shows how to add a UrlAcl for a ServiceControl service that should only respond to a specific DNS name. This would require an update of the ServiceControl configuration file as well. Refer to [setting a custom host name and port number](setting-custom-hostname.md)

```ps
Add-UrlAcl -Url http://servicecontrol.mycompany.com:33333/api/ -Users Users
```
