> [!NOTE]
> Changing the `HostName` value of a ServiceControl instance (including ServiceControl and ServiceControl.Audit) does not change how the embedded RavenDB database is exposed; the embedded RavenDB database remains accessible only via `localhost` and is not bound to any custom hostname or wildcard value.
