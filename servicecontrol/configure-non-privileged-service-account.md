title: Configuring a Non-Privileged Service Account
summary: Using low privilege account for ServiceControl

To allow a non-privileged account to function as the the service account for ServiceControl the following things should be considered:


### Access Control on queues

For MSMQ, the ACL default for a queue allows Administrators full access. Switching to a low privileged account required the modification of rights to give full control to the custom account. Assuming the service name the ServiceControl service is `particular.servicecontrol` the ServiceControl queues names would be

 * `particular.servicecontrol`
 * `particular.servicecontrol.errors`
 * `particular.servicecontrol.staging` (only created from v1.6+)
 * `particular.servicecontrol.timeouts`
 * `particular.servicecontrol.timeoutsdispatcher`

In addition the Service requires rights to the configured audit and error queues and the corresponding forwarding queues. These are typically named:

 * `audit`
 * `error`
 * `error.log`
 * `audit.log`

If the service account user does not have appropriate rights the service will fail.


### Configuration Changes

If the ServiceControl configuration is manually changed to listen to an alternate URL, Check the URLACL assigned to the URI is valid for the new service account. For instructions on how to review and change the the URLACL refer to [Changing the ServiceControl URI](setting-custom-hostname.md)


### RavenDB Security

The installer will set the permissions to allow any member of the local Windows Users group to modify files in the embedded Raven DB folder. These rights can be changed manually to be more restrictive as long as the service account user retains modify rights. Note that manual changes to the ACLs may be lost during an upgrade or re-installation of ServiceControl.


### Testing the Configuration

These methods confirm that the user account has sufficient rights:

 * Configure and start the service as the user and then check the log files. 
 * Interactively run ServiceControl as the user.


#### Method 1: Running the service as a non-privileged user

 1. Open computer management.
 1. Change the service account to the non-privileged user and password and apply the change. The user account will be given "logon as a service privilege".
 1. Start the service and confirm that it started.
 1. Examine the log file to ensure that the service is operating as expected. If the service does not start and the log file does not indicate the issue, try Method 2.


#### Method 2: Running the service interactively as a non-privileged user

To run the service this way the user account must have rights to log on interactively on the computer.
 
 1. Log on to the computer with admin privileges.
 1. Substitute the appropriate domain and user name.
 1. Issue the following command, entering the password when prompted:

For example

```
runas /user:MyDomain\MyTestUser cmd.exe
```

If the command returns the error below then the user account cannot be tested this way without adjusting the logon rights. Normally this only occurs if the computer is configured as a domain controller or the System Administrator has restricted logon access using group policies.

```
1385: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.
```

Once logon rights are granted proceed:

 1. Ensure that the service is stopped.
 1. From the command prompt running as the service account, change to the ServiceControl installation directory and run `ServiceControl.exe` with the `--serviceName` parameter. In the following example the default name has been used. Check the ServiceControl Management Utility if unsure of the service name
 1. Examine the output and confirm that there are no critical errors.
 1. Shut down the console session.
 1. Start the service.

```
ServiceControl.exe --serviceName=Particular.ServiceControl
```

NOTE: Specify the correct name of the service on the command line as this impacts the queues names used.


### Expected Warnings when Running as a Non-Privileged Account

On service start up the Embedded RavenDB attempts to create Windows performance counters. This does not succeed and RavenDB performance counters are not available. This warning can be safely ignored.
