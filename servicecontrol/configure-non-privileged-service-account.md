title: Configuring a Non-Privileged Account
summary: Using a low privilege account for ServiceControl

To allow a low-privileged account to function as the service account for ServiceControl, the following should be considered:


### Access control on queues

The connection string used by ServiceControl must enable access to the following ServicControl queues: 

 * `particular.servicecontrol`
 * `particular.servicecontrol.errors`
 * `particular.servicecontrol.staging` (ServiceControl version 1.6 and above)
 * `particular.servicecontrol.timeouts`
 * `particular.servicecontrol.timeoutsdispatcher`

In addition, connection string must enable access to the configured audit and error queues and the corresponding forwarding queues. These are typical:

 * `audit`
 * `error`
 * `error.log`
 * `audit.log`

If the connection string does not provide appropriate rights, the service will fail to start.

NOTE: For MSMQ, the ACL default for a queue allows Administrators full access. Switching to a low-privileged account requires modification of rights to give full control to the custom account. 

### Url namespace reservations

The account under which the ServiceControl instance is running requires url namespace reservations for the hostname and ports used by the instance. The reservations can be managed from the command using [netsh.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/add-urlacl). For example, to add url reservation for `http:\\localhost:33333\` to `LocalService` account the following command can be used `netsh http add urlacl url=http://localhost:33333/ user=LocalService listen=yes delegate=no`. 

For instructions on how to review and change the urls used by ServiceControl instance, refer to [Changing the ServiceControl URI](setting-custom-hostname.md).

NOTE: ServiceControl exposes endpoints on two different ports, each one requiring separate registration.

### Filesystem paths

The service account running ServiceControl instance requires following filesystem level access rights:

| Path | Rights |
|------|--------|
| Executables (e.g.  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Particular Software\Particular.ServiceControl`) | Read |
| Logs (e.g. `C:\ProgramData\Particular\ServiceControl\Particular.ServiceControl\Logs`)      |   Write     |
| Database (e.g `C:\ProgramData\Particular\ServiceControl\Particular.ServiceControl\DB`) | Write|
| Database volume (e.g. `C:`) | Read Attributes|

NOTE: The database volume `Read attributes` access right is needed by ServiceControl to query for total and total free space on the volume.

### Performance counters
ServiceControl requires access to Windows performance counter infrastructure. As a result the service account needs to be a member of [Performance Monitor Users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#a-href-idbkmk-perfmonitorusersaperformance-monitor-users) group.


### Testing the configuration

These methods confirm that the service account has sufficient rights:

 * Configure the ServiceControl Windows service to run under the custom service account, start it and check the log files.
 * Interactively run ServiceControl under the custom service account.

Note: When running the ServiceControl.exe from the command line, it is important to use the same command line switches that are used when running the Windows service. The command line is visible from within the standard Windows Services user interface.

#### Method 1: Running the service as a non-privileged user

 1. Open Computer Management.
 1. Change the service account to the custom user, provide the password and apply the change. The account will be given "logon as a service" privilege.
 1. Start the service and confirm that it started.
 1. Examine the log file to ensure that the service is operating as expected. If the service does not start and the log file does not indicate the issue, try Method 2.


#### Method 2: Running the service interactively as a non-privileged user

To run the service this way, the custom service account must have rights to log on interactively on the computer.

 1. Log on to the computer with admin privileges.
 1. Switch to the appropriate domain and username.
 1. Issue the following command, entering the password when prompted:

For example

```dos
runas /user:MyDomain\MyTestUser cmd.exe
```

If the command returns the error below, then the user account cannot be tested this way without adjusting the login rights. Normally this only occurs if the computer is configured as a domain controller or the system administrator has restricted login access using group policies.

```
1385: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.
```

Once login rights are granted:

 1. Ensure that the service is stopped.
 1. From the command prompt running as the service account, change to the ServiceControl installation directory and run `ServiceControl.exe` with the `--serviceName` parameter. In the following example, the default name has been used. Check ServiceControl Management if unsure of the service name
 1. Examine the output and confirm that there are no critical errors.
 1. Shut down the console session.
 1. Start the service.

```dos
ServiceControl.exe --serviceName=Particular.ServiceControl
```

NOTE: Specify the correct name of the service on the command line as this impacts the queue names used.
