Plugins send messages using the defined endpoint transport to ServiceControl. The plugin must be configured with the location of the ServiceControl input queue. This queue is created during the [installation of ServiceControl](/servicecontrol/installation.md). The queue name is based on the ServiceControl instance name which is visible in the ServiceControl Management utility.
