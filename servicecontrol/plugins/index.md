WARNING: ServiceControl plugin packages (ServiceControl.Plugin.*) have been deprecated and replaced by new packages in the operations and debugging space: [NServiceBus.Heartbeat](/nservicebus/operations/heartbeat.md), [NServiceBus.CustomChecks](/nservicebus/operations/custom-checks.md) and [NServiceBus.SagaAudit](/nservicebus/sagas/saga-audit.md).

The deprecated packages continue to work and can still be used until solutions are migrated to the new packages.
