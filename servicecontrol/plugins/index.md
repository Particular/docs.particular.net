WARNING: ServiceControl plugin packages (ServiceControl.Plugin.*) have been deprecated and replaced by new packages in the operations and debugging space: [NServiceBus.Heartbeat](/monitoring/heartbeats/), [NServiceBus.CustomChecks](/monitoring/custom-checks/) and [NServiceBus.SagaAudit](/nservicebus/sagas/saga-audit.md).

The deprecated packages continue to work and can still be used until solutions are migrated to the new packages.
