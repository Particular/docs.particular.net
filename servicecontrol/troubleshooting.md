### Port 33333 is already in use by another service

1. This is most probably due to a previous install of ServiceControl beta (previously known as "Management API").
1. Uninstall previous ServiceControl beta versions by following this process:
1. In the Windows Computer Management > Services check for the existence of a service named "Particular.Management";
1. If there is a service called "Particular.Management" uninstall previous versions of ServiceInsight beta (can be located and uninstalled in Control Panel > Programs as "Particular Software ServiceInsight";
1. If a version of NServiceBus 4.0 or later is already installed, Open its installer modification settings (in Control Panel > Programs select "Change" for the "Particular Software NServiceBus);
1. In the NServiceBus installer click "Modify";
1. Uncheck "Management API" in the list of components to be installed with NServiceBus;
1. Click "Modify" to apply changed and re-run installation;

### Unable to connect to ServiceControl from either ServiceInsight or ServicePulse

1. In Computer Management > Services, check that the Windows Service "Particular ServiceControl" is running
1. In any browser or HTTP client, enter a GET request for the ServiceControl HTTP API (default URI: `http://localhost:33333/api`). 
1. You should get a valid response with JSON data containing ServiceControl default settings.
1. Verify that firewall settings do not block access to the ServiceControl port (default: 33333) and that the default URI is accessible and responsive from a browser / HTTP client from the machine on which ServicePulse or ServiceInsight is trying to connect to ServiceControl


### Unable to start Particular.ServiceControl as a standard user

1. If the Particular.ServiceControl fails to start and it is set to run with a standard user account (no elevated or specific privileges) this may be due to missing access rights to storage directory in which the internal database is located (by default, this is the `C:\ProgramData\Particular` directory
2. To fix this issue:
   * Grant the user read/write access to the `C:\ProgramData\Particular` location
   * Grant the user access rights to run the service listening on the selected domain and port number by running the following commands (replacing the default URL and USERS parameters):
   
```
netsh http delete urlacl url=http://localhost:33333/api/
netsh http add urlacl url=http://localhost:33333/api/ user=<accountname> Listen=yes
```

### Particular.ServiceControl windows service fails to start

* There are various reasons that can cause the Particular.ServiceControl windows service fail to start. To narrow down the possible cause, review the ServiceControl logs files located in:
    * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Particular\ServiceControl\logs` if the issue relates to the ServiceControl installation process;
    * `%WINDIR%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Particular\ServiceControl\logs` if the issue relates to ServiceControl normal operations. Logs location may vary depending on the user that has been configured to run the ServiceControl service, the above one is the one where the LocalSystem user outputs logs information;
* Most common cause is prerequisites installation and configuration issues;
