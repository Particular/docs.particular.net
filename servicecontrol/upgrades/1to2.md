## Overview

Upgrading ServiceControl from version 1 to version 2 is a major upgrade and requires careful planning. During the upgrade process, the instance of ServiceControl that is being upgraded will no longer be available and will not be ingesting any messages. The upgrade process is not reversible and cannot be undone once started.

### Upgrading ServiceControl

Due to the intrusive nature of this upgrade, there are two main ways to upgrade to version 2 of ServiceControl. The first is to perform an in-place upgrade, while the second is to deploy a separate instance of ServiceControl version 2 while still leaving the current version 1 instance running in production. Both of these options are discussed in more details below.

### In-place upgrade to version 2

WARN: The migration is managed by the ServiceControl Management Utility instance upgrade process and does not require manual intervention. It is recommended, however, to [back up the RavenDB](/servicecontrol/backup-sc-database.md) database prior to attempting the upgrade.

The upgrade is triggered through the ServiceControl Management application. ServiceControl Management will display the instances of the ServiceControl service installed. If the version of the binaries used by an instance are older that those shipped with ServiceControl Management an upgrade link will be shown against the version label.

To upgrade the service just click the upgrade link next to the Service name

Clicking the upgrade link will

 * Prompt for any additional information that is required such as values for new mandatory settings introduced in the newer version.
 * Stop the Service.
 * Remove the old binaries for ServiceControl and the configured Transport.
 * Run the new binaries to create any required queues.
 * Start the Service.

WARN: This upgrade process is intrusive and may take a long time to progress. Tests in lab environments showed that upgrading a 300Gb database can take upwards of nearly 5 hours on 4000 IOPs drives. 

### Side-by-side upgrade process

A side-by-side upgrade process allows for zero downtime in ServiceControl and a controlled migration between versions. Instead of upgrading the existing instance of ServiceControl, the new instance is left running but is configured to no longer ingest any messages. A new instance of ServiceControl version 2 is installed and configured to ingest messages from the audit and error queues that the previous instance used to ingest from. The new instance is also configured as a [master instance of the previous instance](/servicecontrol-instances/distributed-instances#advanced-scenarios-migration). This results in 2 instances of ServiceControl, where the new instance will ingest any future messages and the previous instance will contain all messages previously ingested but will no longer ingest any messages. All ServiceInsight instances must then be configured to connect to the new instance of ServiceControl. Since the new instance is a master instance of the previous instance, ServiceInsight will be able to show audited messages from both the previous instance as well as the new instance of ServiceControl.

The process for side-by-side upgrade is as follows:

1. Configure the existing instance of ServiceControl to ingest audit and error messages from a queue named `!disable`
  * This will ensure that the previous instance of ServiceControl no longer ingests any messages
2. Add a new instance of ServiceControl and configure it to ingest messages from the error and audit queues that the previous instance used to ingest messages from
3. Configure the previous instance of ServiceControl as a slave of the new instance by adding the previous instance to the `RemoteInstances` setting of the new instance's `app.config`

```xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="ServiceControl/RemoteInstances" value="[{'api_uri':'http://localhost:33333/api', 'queue_address':'Particular.ServiceControl'}]'"/>
    <!-- The URI and queue address here are the URI and queue of the previous instance of ServiceControl -->
  </appSettings>/
</configuration>
```
4. Start both instances of ServiceControl
5. Configure ServiceInsight to connect to the new instance of ServiceControl instead of the previous instance

At this stage, new messages will be ingested by the version 2 instance of ServiceControl, while ServiceInsight will show data from both instances. The next step is to migrate error messages from the previous instance to the new instance. The easiest way to do this is to retry all of the failed messages back into production. If the messages fail again, they will be resent back to the error queue which means they will then be ingested by the new instance of ServiceControl again.

6. Using ServicePulse, retry all of the failed messages currently in the previous version of ServiceControl
7. Configure ServicePulse to now connect to the new instance of ServiceControl

Once these steps have been completed, the previous instance of ServiceControl will only contain audit messages and the new instance of ServiceControl will contain the error messages and will ingest any new messages. The previous instance will slowly clean up any of it's audit messages as time goes on due to the [audit message retention period](/servicecontrol/creating-config-file#data-retention-servicecontrolauditretentionperiod) which will result in an empty database after all audit messages have been evicted. This means that it is safe to remove the previous instance of ServiceControl once that audit retention period has elapsed as there will no longer be any audit messages in that database.

#### Caveats

If it is not possible to retry the failed messages back into production, a second instance of ServicePulse must be installed so that 1 instance of ServicePulse communicates with the previous instance of ServiceControl and the 2nd instance of ServicePulse communicates with the new instance of ServiceControl.
