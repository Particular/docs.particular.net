## RabbitMQ delivery limit validation

ServiceControl version 6.5.x uses RabbitMQ transport version 10.x.  This version of the transport uses the management API to validate that the delivery limit of each NServiceBus quorum queue is set to `unlimited`, so as not to interfere with NServiceBus' recoverability functionality.

The [management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management#getting-started) is required to be installed on the node.  If the management API's host and/or user credentials are different than the values in the broker connection string, then they can be configured using the [RabbitMQ transport configuration options](/servicecontrol/transports.md#rabbitmq).

## Usage reporting configuration

If the RabbitMQ transport is used for an error instance, and the [usage reporting](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/configuration.md#usage-reporting-when-using-the-rabbitmq-transport) configuration values are already set in the `ServiceControl.exe.config`, ServiceControl will attempt to migrate the settings to the error instance's connection string.

However, this automatic transfer only applies to the error instance. The audit and monitoring instances will not inherit the values from the usage reporting settings, and their connection strings must be configured manually.
