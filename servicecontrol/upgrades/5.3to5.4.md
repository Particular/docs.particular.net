## ServicePulse compatibility

ServiceControl version 5.4 requires a ServicePulse version greater or equal to 1.40 to utilize the new [usage](./../../servicepulse/usage.md) summary and reporting features.

## Usage setup

In most scenarios existing ServiceControl error instance connection settings will be used to establish the required connections to collect usage data.
The [Usage setup](./../../servicepulse/usage-config.md) section in ServicePulse can be used to setup and troubleshoot connection settings.
