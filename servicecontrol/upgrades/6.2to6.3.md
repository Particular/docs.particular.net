## RabbitMQ delivery limit validation

ServiceControl version 6.3 uses rabbitMQ transport version 10.x.  When using RabbitMQ 4 and above the management API is required as part of the transport to validate the delivery limit of a quorum queue to insure that it's set to unlimited (-1) for proper recoverability functionality.

The [management API plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management#getting-started) is required to be installed on the node.  If the configuration of the management API is different than the default values based on the broker connection string, then the connection can be configured using the [RabbitMQ transport configuration options](/servicecontrol/transports.md#rabbitmq).
