ServiceControl version 6 updates the underlying data storage from RavenDB 5 to RavenDB 6. Once upgraded, the database cannot be downgraded.

Users hosting ServiceControl in containerized infrastructure must also make changes to ensure data is accessible in the new version.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading to ServiceControl version 6, ensure all ServiceControl instances have first been upgraded to version 5.11.0.

## Container changes

When using the [`servicecontrol-ravendb` container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/particular/servicecontrol-ravendb), the following changes must be made when upgrading to ServiceControl version 6:

1. The [required volume mount location](/servicecontrol/ravendb/containers.md#required-settings) must be changed:
    * Version 5: `/opt/RavenDB/Server/RavenData`
    * Version 6: `/var/lib/ravendb/data`
    * If the container mount path is not changed, the container will refuse to start.
2. On Linux hosts, the permissions for the data volume must be changed to user id 999.
    * With access to the volume, this can be accomplished using the following command:
        ```bash
        chown -R 999:999 /path/to/data/volume
        ```
    * This is due to RavenDB version 6 running as a non-root user.
    * Users running containers via Docker Desktop do not need to do this as Docker Desktop abstracts away group/owner permissions.

Keep in mind that the tag version of `servicecontrol-ravendb` must match the version of the other ServiceControl container images.

## Support for version 5

Version 5 is supported for one year after version 6 is released as defined by the [ServiceControl support policy](/servicecontrol/upgrades/support-policy.md). The ServiceControl support end date is available at [ServiceControl supported versions](/servicecontrol/upgrades/supported-versions.md).
