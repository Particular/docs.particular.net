The configuration of a ServiceControl instance can be adjusted via the ServiceControl Management utility or by directly modifying the `ServiceControl.exe.config` file. The settings listed are applicable to the `appSettings` section of the configuration file unless otherwise specified.

The configuration of a ServiceControl Error instance is controlled by the `ServiceControl.exe.config` file or by setting environment variables. When a setting configuration exists as both an environment variable and in the application configuration file the environment variable setting takes precedence.

Deployments using the ServiceControl Management utility (SCMU) can use that application to make a subset of configuration settings which are read from and written to the application configuration file.

## Host settings

The following documents should be reviewed prior to modifying configuration settings:

* [Setting a Custom Hostname](/servicecontrol/setting-custom-hostname.md) for guidance and details.
* [Securing ServiceControl](/servicecontrol/securing-servicecontrol.md) for an overview of the security implications of changing the configuration.

### ServiceControl/MaximumConcurrencyLevel

This setting controls how many messages can be processed concurrently (in parallel) by ServiceControl. The default value is 10.

In some cases, the ingestion rate can be too high and the underlying database cannot keep up with indexing the new messages. In this case, consider lowering the maximum concurrency level to a value that still allows a suitable ingestion rate while easing the pressure on the database.

> [!WARNING]
> The maximum concurrency level should be incremented only if there are no verified bottlenecks in CPU, RAM, network I/O, storage I/O, and storage index lag.

The transport type to run ServiceControl with.

| Context | Name |

### ServiceControl/ForwardErrorMessages

Use this setting to configure whether processed error messages are forwarded to another queue or not. This entry should be set to `false` if there is no external process reading messages from the [`ServiceBus/ErrorLogQueue`](#transport-servicecontrolforwarderrormessages).

| Context | Name |
| --- | --- |
| **Environment variable** | `SERVICECONTROL_FORWARDERRORMESSAGES` |
| **App config key** | `ServiceControl/ForwardErrorMessages` |
| **SCMU field** | `ERROR FORWARDING` |

| Type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| bool | `false` (Off) |

This entry should be set to `false` if there is no external process reading messages from the `Error Forwarding Queue`.

### ServiceBus/ErrorLogQueue

The error queue name to use for forwarding error messages. This setting is ignored unless `ServiceControl/ForwardErrorMessages` is enabled.

| Context | Name |
| --- | --- |
| **Environment variable** | `SERVICEBUS_ERRORLOGQUEUE` |

## Usage Reporting when using ServiceControl

### LicensingComponent/ServiceControlThroughputDataQueue

Version: 5.4.0+

The queue on which throughput data is received by the ServiceControl Error instance. This setting must match the equivalent [`Monitoring/ServiceControlThroughputDataQueue`](/servicecontrol/monitoring-instances/configuration.md#usage-reporting-monitoringservicecontrolthroughputdataqueue) setting for the Monitoring instance.

In most instances these settings do not need to be modified.

If running multiple setups of the Platform Tools (i.e. multiple versions of ServiceControl error and monitoring instances) then modify these settings so that the queue on each monitoring instance is matched to the queue of its error instance.

If using [MSMQ transport](/transports/msmq) and the monitoring instance is installed on a different machine than the ServiceControl error instance, only the monitoring instance setting needs to be modified to include the machine name of the error instance in the queue address.

| Context | Name |
| --- | --- |

| **App config key** | `LicensingComponent/ServiceControlThroughputDataQueue` |

### ServiceControl/DataSpaceRemainingThreshold

The percentage threshold for the [Message database storage space](/servicecontrol/servicecontrol-instances/#notifications-health-monitoring-message-database-storage-space) check. If the remaining hard drive space drops below this threshold (as a percentage of the total space on the drive), then the check will fail, alerting the user.
