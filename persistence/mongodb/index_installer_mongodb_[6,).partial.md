Indexes are only created when the installers are enabled.

In non-development environments, where the indexes are managed by other means (e.g. Ops Manager), it may be necessary to explicitly disable the persistence installers if [standard installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) need to be used for other purposes.
