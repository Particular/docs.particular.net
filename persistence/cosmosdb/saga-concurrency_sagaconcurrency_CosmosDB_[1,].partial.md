By default, CosmosDB persistence uses [optimistic concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) when updating or deleting saga data, though starting with NServiceBus.CosmosDB version 2.0, it's possible to configure the persister to use pessimistic locking. See later in this document for how to do this.
