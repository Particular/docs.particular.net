> [!WARNING]
> For control messages, a default partition key in the format `{messageId}` will be used; however, these Outbox records are not separated by endpoint name. As a result, multiple logical endpoints _cannot_ share the same database and container since [message identities are not unique across endpoints from a processing perspective](/nservicebus/outbox/#message-identity). To avoid conflicts, either separate different endpoints into different containers, [override the partition key](transactions.md), or update to the latest package of `NServiceBus.Persistence.CosmosDB`.
