## Summary

This guidance explains how add missing unique constraints on saga correlation property columns. This is described in the issue "[Unique constraints are not generated for saga correlation properties](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.NHibernate/issues/280)".

This issue may cause multiple rows in saga data table that represent the same logical saga instance. The duplicated rows are inserted as a result of race condition during saga creation and missing unique constraint on correlation property column.


## Compatibility

This issue has been resolved in the following patch versions of the [NHibernate Persistence](/persistence/nhibernate/) as defined in the NServiceBus [support policy](/nservicebus/upgrades/support-policy.md):

 * [7.2.1](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.NHibernate/releases/tag/7.2.1)
 * [7.1.6](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus.NHibernate/releases/tag/7.1.6)

Affected versions (7.1 and later) that are still [supported](/nservicebus/upgrades/supported-versions.md#persistence-packages-nservicebus-nhibernate) should be updated to the latest patch release.


## Upgrade steps

Steps:

 * For each saga data table:
    * Check if any duplicate values exist in the correlation property column.
    * Merge duplicate rows so that there are no duplicate values in the correlation property column.
    * Add unique constraint on correlation property column
 * Update endpoint to latest patch release.
 * Deploy the new version.


### Checking for duplicate correlation property values

The following query detects duplicate rows in the saga data table - it requires providing values for `sagaDataTableName` and `correlationPropertyColumnName` variables.

Each row in the result set represents a single logical saga instance that was duplicated. The first column of the result will show the correlation property value for logical saga instance.


#### Microsoft SQL Server

snippet: DetectSagaDataDuplicates_MsSqlServer


#### Oracle

snippet:  DetectSagaDataDuplicates_Oracle


### Add unique constraint on correlation property column

The unique constraint on correlation property column can be added with following query - it requires providing values for `sagaDataTableName` and `correlationPropertyColumnName` variables.


#### Microsoft SQL Server

NOTE: If adding a unique constraint fails with the error `The CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement terminated because a duplicate key was found for the object name ...` ensure that all duplicated rows detected have been merged.

#### Oracle

NOTE: Oracle requires that a unique constraint has a name. Use the `uniqueConstraintName` variable to set the name of the constraint.
