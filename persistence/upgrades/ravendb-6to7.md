Starting with NServiceBus.RavenDB version 6.2.0, the built-in gateway API has been obsoleted with the following message:

> RavenDB gateway persistence has been moved to the NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB dedicated package. Will be treated as an error from version 7.0.0. Will be removed in version 8.0.0.

To migrate to the new gateway API:

- Add a reference to the `NServiceBus.Gateway.RavenDB` NuGet package and configure the gateway feature following the instructions available in the [RavenDB Gateway Storage documentation](/nservicebus/gateway/ravendb/).
- Remove any configuration that uses the legacy gateway API.
