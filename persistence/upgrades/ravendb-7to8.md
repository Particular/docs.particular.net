## Timeout storage

The [timeout manager is removed from core](/nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/#timeout-manager-removed) which makes timeout storage obsolete.

- Any configuration APIs can safely be removed.
- Database tables must be manually removed from storage.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no automatic migration of timeout data. See [Timeout manager removed - Data migration](/nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/#timeout-manager-removed-data-migration).
