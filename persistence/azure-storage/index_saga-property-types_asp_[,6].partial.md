Azure Storage Persistence supports exactly the same set of types as [Azure Table Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-the-table-service-data-model). When a saga containing a property of an unsupported type is persisted, an exception containing a following information is thrown: `The property type 'the_property_name' is not supported in windows azure table storage`. If an object of a non-supported type is required to be stored, then it's a user responsibility to serialize/deserialize the value.
