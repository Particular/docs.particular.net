Azure Storage Persistence supports same set of types as [Azure Table Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-the-table-service-data-model) and additional types that can be serialized into JSON. When a saga containing a property of an unsupported type is persisted, an exception containing a following information is thrown: `The property type 'the_property_name' is not supported in Windows Azure Table Storage and it cannot be serialized with JSON.NET`.
