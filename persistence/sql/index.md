Stores NServiceBus data in various relational database engines, without the need for an intermediate ORM, using only a configured `DbConnection`.

## Persistence at a glance

For a description of each feature, see the [persistence at a glance legend](/persistence/#persistence-at-a-glance).

|Feature                    |   |
|:---                       |---
|Storage Types              |Sagas, Outbox, Subscriptions, Timeouts
|Transactions               |Local database transactions or distributed transactions when available
|Concurrency control        |Optimistic concurrency for correctness + pessimistic concurrency for performance
|Scripted deployment        |SQL scripts generated at compile time, can be [promoted outside build directory](controlling-script-generation.md#promotion).
|Installers                 |Installers execute the generated scripts, which can be enabled in development.



## Highlights

* Supports [multiple database engines](#supported-sql-implementations).
* No ORM dependency: can be used with Entity Framework, Dapper, etc.
* Independent tables for each endpoint. No "noisy neighbor" problems.
* [Generates DDL scripts at compile time](controlling-script-generation.md) in the build output directory.
* Generated scripts can be [promoted outside the build directory ](controlling-script-generation.md#promotion) and:
  * Added to source control.
  * Compared using a diff viewer.
  * Inspected by DBAs.
  * Treated as first-class citizens in operations workflows for [installation and deployment](install.md).
* Sagas are:
  * Stored using [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) to serialize complex data structures, with no need to manage complex table structures.
  * Built to be [version-aware](saga.md#json-net-settings-custom-settings-version-specific-type-specific-deserialization-settings) with support for data evolution.
  * Built to [allow changing the `CorrelationId` over time](saga.md#correlation-ids).

## Script creation

SQL installation scripts are created as a compile-time output alongside a project's binary outputs. Additionally, these scripts can be promoted to a directory under source control so that differences can be easily tracked and analyzed. To learn more, see [Controlling Script Generation](/persistence/sql/controlling-script-generation.md).

WARNING: The scripts are generated by an MSBuild task at compile time. Any project containing either endpoint configuration or sagas must **directly** reference the SQL Persistence package. If endpoint configuration and sagas are contained in seperate projects, **both** projects must directly reference the SQL Persistence package and include the `assembly: SqlPersistenceSettings` attribute.
