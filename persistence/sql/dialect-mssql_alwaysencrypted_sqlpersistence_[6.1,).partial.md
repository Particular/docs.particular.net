The SQL Server dialect has support for [SQL Server Always Encrypted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine).

Note: Always Encrypted support only works with `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`.

The steps to make use of SQL Always Encrypted are:

1. Make sure SQL Always Encrypted is configured correctly with the correct certificate or key stores on the database engine and the client machines.
1. Encrypt the `Body` column for the saga table that encryption is being enabled for. For more information on how to encrypt columns in SQL Server, refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/sqlclient-support-always-encrypted?view=sql-server-ver15#retrieving-and-modifying-data-in-encrypted-columns).
1. Encrypt the `Operations` column for the `OutboxData` table. This contains business data in the form of outgoing messages. There is a separate `OutboxData` table for every endpoint that uses the outbox feature.
1. Ensure the connection string for the endpoint includes the `Column Encryption Setting = Enabled;` connection string parameter.

The `Body` and `Operations` columns will now be readable only by clients that have the correct certificate or key stores configured.

Note: Encrypting columns requires a few parameters including the type of encryption, the algorithm and the key. Installers currently do not support encryption, therefore, [installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) cannot be enabled in combination with SQL Server Always Encrypted.
