{{Note: The SQL persistence will not validate name length, for two reasons. Firstly, the supported name length values are higher and should be sufficient for typical scenarios. Secondly, it is possible to modify the database setting locally to support longer names. In case of long names for sagas, etc. the database engine may perform automatic name truncation.
