To ensure correctness, when creating new sagas, the persister applies [optimistic concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) using an incrementing counter. The persister uses an explicit version column combined with the `ReadComitted` isolation level.

However, to avoid excessive conflicts for highly congested sagas, starting in version 4.1 the persister uses pessimistic concurrency for querying and updating saga information. The pessimistic concurrency is implemented using a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` construct or its dialect-specific equivalent.
