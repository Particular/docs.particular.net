## Sharing the transaction

Once a behavior is introduced to identify the partition key for a given message, it is possible to share a batch, represented in Azure Table by `List<TableTransactionAction>` between both the Saga persistence and business data. This list can then be used to persist document updates for both concerns atomically.

### Within a handler method using `IMessageHandlerContext`

To use the shared `List<TableTransactionAction>` in a message handler:

snippet: HandlerSharedTransaction

#### Testing

The `TestableAzureTableStorageSession` class in the `NServiceBus.Testing` namespace has been provided to facilitate [testing a handler](/nservicebus/testing/) that utilizes the shared transaction feature.

### With dependency injection

For custom types that require access to the shared `List<TableTransactionAction>`:

And alternatively to using the the extension method `IMessageHandlerContext.SynchronizedStorageSession.AzureTablePersistenceSession()`:
