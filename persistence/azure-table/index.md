Certain features of NServiceBus require persistence to permanently store data. Among them are subscription storage, sagas, and outbox. Various storage options are available including Azure Table and Azure Cosmos DB Table API.

Azure Table Persistence stores NServiceBus data in [Azure Table storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/) or [Azure Cosmos DB using the Table API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table-support/).

## Persistence at a glance

For a description of each feature, see the [persistence at a glance legend](/persistence/#persistence-at-a-glance).

|Feature                    |   |
|:---                       |---
|Supported storage types    |Sagas, Outbox, Subscriptions
|Transactions               |Using TransactionalBatch, [with caveats](transactions.md)
|Concurrency control        |Optimistic concurrency
|Scripted deployment        |Not supported
|Installers                 |Supported. Subscription, the default table or saga tables derived by convention when no default table is set are created at runtime, when enabled.
