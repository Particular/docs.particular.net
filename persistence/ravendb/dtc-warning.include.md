> In RavenDB 3.5, the client implementation of distributed transactions contains a bug that could cause an endpoint to lose data under rare conditions. If RavenDB is configured to enlist in distributed transactions with RavenDB 3.5, read [DTC not supported for RavenDB Persistence](/persistence/ravendb/dtc.md).
