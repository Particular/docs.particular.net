Starting with NServiceBus.RavenDB version 6.3, it is recommended to disable cleanup and rely on [document expiration](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/latest/csharp/server/extensions/expiration) instead.

Cleanup may be disabled by specifying `Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan` for `SetFrequencyToRunDeduplicationDataCleanup`:

If document expiration cannot be used, to improve efficiency it is advised to run cleanup on only one endpoint instance per RavenDB database, by disabling clean up on all other endpoint instances.

WARN: If document expiration is not being used when running in [multi-tenant mode](/persistence/ravendb/#multi-tenant-support), cleanup needs to be handled manually, since NServiceBus does not know what databases are in use.
