The [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox) feature requires persistence in order to store messages and enable deduplication.

## Storage format

The persister stores outbox data for all endpoints in a [collection](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/7.0/csharp/client-api/faq/what-is-a-collection) called `OutboxRecords`. To separate data for individual endpoints stored documents will have their endpoint name embedded in the document ID using the following format `Outbox/{Endpoint-name}/{Message-id}`.

## Deduplication record lifespan

partial: cleanup
