The following sections outline various ways to connect to the RavenDB server. Specifying an external shared store (providing a fully configured RavenDB `DocumentStore` instance) is preferred so that the configuration of the DocumentStore is not obscured.

## Default

By default, a `DocumentStore` is created that connects to `http://localhost:8080` and uses the endpoint name as its database name. This default connection is used for all the persisters.


## Database used

After connecting to a RavenDB server, decide which database to use. Unless NServiceBus finds a default database specified in the connection string, NServiceBus uses the endpoint name as the database name. This means that if the endpoint is named `MyServer`, the database name will be `MyServer`. Each endpoint has a separate database unless explicitly overridden via the connection string. Prior to RavenDB 4.0, RavenDB automatically creates the database if it doesn't already exist, but this is no longer the case in RavenDB 4.0 and above.

See also [How to specify endpoint name](/nservicebus/endpoints/specify-endpoint-name.md).
