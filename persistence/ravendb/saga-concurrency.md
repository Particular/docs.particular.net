## Default behavior

When simultaneously handling messages, conflicts may occur. See below for examples of the exceptions which are thrown. _[Saga concurrency](/nservicebus/sagas/concurrency.md)_ explains how these conflicts are handled, and contains guidance for high-load scenarios.

### Creating saga data

Example exception:

```
Raven.Client.Exceptions.ConcurrencyException: Document OrderSagaData/OrderId/316414b3-07f1-40ec-00db-022a4140d517 has change vector A:2-u2LvKAFZTE+972x2hp1gTg, but Put was called with expecting new document. Optimistic concurrency violation, transaction will be aborted.
```

### Updating or deleting saga data

partial: concurrency

WARNING: When a message handler does not change saga data, the RavenDB client will not attempt to write the associated document to storage. If a consistency check is required, a property value must be changed. For example, a counter property may be incremented.

Example exception:

```
Raven.Client.Exceptions.ConcurrencyException: Document OrderSagaDatas/f23921c9-7b53-455d-89be-aad200d98741 has change vector A:93-u2LvKAFZTE+972x2hp1gTg, but Put was called with change vector A:90-u2LvKAFZTE+972x2hp1gTg. Optimistic concurrency violation, transaction will be aborted.
