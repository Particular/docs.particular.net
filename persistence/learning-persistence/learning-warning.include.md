DANGER: The [Learning Transport](/nservicebus/learning-transport/) and [Learning Persistence](/nservicebus/learning-persistence/) are not for production use. They are designed for short term learning and experimentation purposes. It should also not be used for longer-term development, i.e. the same transport and persistence used in production should be used in development and debug scenarios. Select a production transport and persistence before developing features. Do not use the learning transport or learning persistence to perform any kind of performance analysis.
