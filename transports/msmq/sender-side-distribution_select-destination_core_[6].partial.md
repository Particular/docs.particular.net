In Versions 6.2 and above it is possible to override the virtual method `SelectDestination`. The method provides access to the `DistributionStrategyContext` that enables implementing more advanced distribution scenarios, such as distributing based on the headers of the message. When `SelectDestination` is overridden, do not call `base.SelectDestination` since the base method calls `SelectReceiver` for backward compatibility reasons.
