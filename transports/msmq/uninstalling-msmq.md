The Platform Installer and the NServiceBus.PowerShell modules provide a simple mechanism for installing and configuring the MSMQ service to suit NServiceBus. Particular does not provide an uninstall for this as there are inbuilt removal options within the Windows Operating system.

The removal instructions vary depend on the operating system and are detailed below.


## Before proceeding

DANGER: Removing the MSMQ Service is a destructive operation which can result in data loss

When the MSMQ service is uninstalled the following actions are also carried out:

 * All existing queues and queue configuration information is deleted
 * All messages contained in those queue and the system dead letter queue (DLQ) is deleted


### Dependent Services

Services in Microsoft Windows can be configured to depend on each other. Prior to removing MSMQ, ensure that no services are dependent upon the MSMQ. To do this

 * Load the Windows Services MMC snapin `Services.msc`,
 * Right click on `Message Queuing` in the list of services
 * Check the `Dependencies` Tab in the window to see if any dependencies exist 

Alternatively this can be done from PowerShell via the following command:

```ps
(Get-Service MSMQ).DependentServices
```


## Removal Instructions


### Interactive Removal


#### Windows 2012

 * Open Server Manager
 * From the manage menu, click the Remove Roles and Features
 * This will open the "Remove Roles and Features" Wizard
 * Click `Next` until the Features option is shown
 * Scroll down and deselect the `Message Queuing` option and then click `Next`
 * Click the `Remove` Button to complete the removal.

A reboot may be required to finalize the changes.


#### Windows 8

 * Open the Programs option from Control Panel
 * Under Programs and Features click on `Turn Windows features on or off`
 * Scroll down and deselect the `Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ) Server` option and then click `OK`

Reboot to finalize the changes.


### Removal using DISM.exe

`DISM.exe` is the command line tool Microsoft provides for enabling and disabling Windows Features such as the MSMQ subsystem on Windows 7, 8 and Windows Server 2008 and 2012.

`DISM.exe` requires admin privileges so all the commands listed should be run from an admin command prompt.

NOTE: DISM command line options and feature names are all case sensitive.

To list which MSMQ features are enabled execute:

```dos
DISM /Online /Get-Features /Format:Table | FINDSTR "^MSMQ-"
```

The output will be similar to this:

```
MSMQ-Container                                        | Enabled
MSMQ-Server                                           | Enabled
MSMQ-Triggers                                         | Disabled
MSMQ-ADIntegration                                    | Disabled
MSMQ-HTTP                                             | Disabled
MSMQ-Multicast                                        | Disabled
MSMQ-DCOMProxy                                        | Disabled
WCF-MSMQ-Activation45                                 | Disabled
```

To disable a feature execute the following:

```dos
DISM /Online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:<FeatureName>
```

Once a feature is remove reboot the system to finalize the changes.


#### Removal using PowerShell Prompt

Windows 8.x and Windows Server 2012 ship with a PowerShell module for managing installed features that mirrors the DISM.exe command line functions.

The following PowerShell script uses the DISM Module to remove any `MSMQ` features form the system.

```ps
Import-Module DISM
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online |
 ? FeatureName -Match MSMQ |
 ? State -EQ Enabled | % {
	 Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $_.FeatureName -NoRestart
}
```

The script is suppressing restarts to stop a prompt being shown for each feature as it is removed. Once the script has completed the system should be restarted to finalize the changes.
