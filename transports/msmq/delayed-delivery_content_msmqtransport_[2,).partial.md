Because MSMQ lacks a mechanism for sending delayed messages, the MSMQ transport uses an external store for delayed messages. Messages that are to be delivered later (e.g. [saga timeouts](/nservicebus/sagas/timeouts.md) or [delayed retries](/nservicebus/recoverability/configure-delayed-retries.md)) are persisted in the delayed message store until they are due. When a message is due, it is retreived from the store and dispatched to its destination.

The MSMQ transport requires explicit configuration to enable delayed message delivery. For example:

snippet: delayed-delivery

The SQL Server delayed message store (`SqlServerDelayedMessageStore`) is the only delayed message store that ships with the MSMQ transport.

### How it works

A delayed message store implements the `IDelayedMessageStore` interface. Delayed message delivery has two parts:

### Storing of delayed messages

A delayed message is stored using the `Store` method.

### Polling and dispatching of delayed messages

The message store is polled for due delayed messages in a background task which periodically calls `FetchNextDueTimeout`. If the method returns a message, the message is sent (see next paragraph), and the method is immediately called again. If the method returns `null`, `Next` is called, which returns either a `DateTimeOffset` indicating when the next message will be due, or `null` if there are no delayed messages. If another delayed message is persisted in the meantime, using the `Store` method.

When a due delayed message is returned by `FetchNextDueTimeout`, the message is sent to the destination queue and then removed from the store using the `Remove` method. In case of an unexpected exception during forwarding the failure is registered using `IncrementFailureCount`. If the configured number of retries is exhausted the message is forwarded to the configured `error` queue.

## Using a custom delayed message store

Create a class which implements the `IDelayedMessageStore` interface and pass an instance to the `DelayedDeliverySettings` constructor.

### Consistency

In `TransactionScope` [transaction mode](/transports/transactions.md), the delayed message store is expected to enlist in the `TransactionScope` to ensure **exactly once** behavior. `FetchNextDueTimeout`, `Remove`, and sending messages to their destination queues are all executed in a single distributed transaction. The built-in SQL Server store supports this mode of operation.

In lower transaction modes the dispatch behavior is **at least once**. `FetchNextDueTimeout` and `Remove` are executed in the same `TransactionScope` but sending messages to their destination queues is executed in a separate (inner) transport scope. If `Remove` fails, the message will be sent to the destination queue multiple times and the destination endpoint must handle the duplicates, using either the [outbox feature](/nservicebus/outbox/) or a custom de-duplication mechanism.

The built-in SQL Server delayed message store takes a pessimistic lock on the delayed message row in the `FetchNextDueTimeout` operation to prevent other physical instances of the same logical endpoint from delivering the same delayed message. A custom delayed message store must also take some kind of lock to prevent this from happening. For example, a delayed message store using Azure Blog Storage may take a lease lock.
