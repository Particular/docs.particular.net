There are several ways to view content in MSMQ, both free and paid.

### Visual Studio

The queues on the local machine can be listed using Server Explorer in Visual Studio:

If there is a message in one of the queues, select it and view the properties of the message in the property panel in Visual Studio (usually on the bottom right):

![Visual Studio properties](visual-studio-properties.png "Visual Studio properties")

The most interesting property is the BodyStream as it shows the contents of the message:

### Windows native tools

The MSMQ MMC snap-in can be used to manage queues.

Use one of the following based in Windows:

```
Start > Run > compmgmt.msc > Features > Message Queuing
```

or

```
Start > Run > compmgmt.msc > Services and Applications > Message Queuing
```


### QueueExplorer
