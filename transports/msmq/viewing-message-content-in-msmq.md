### Visual Studio

The queues on the local machine can be listed using Server Explorer in Visual Studio:

![Server Explorer](server-explorer.png "Server Explorer")

If there is a message in one of the queues, select it and view the properties of the message in the property panel in Visual Studio (usually on the bottom right):

![Visual Studio properties](visual-studio-properties.png "Visual Studio properties")

The most interesting property is the BodyStream as it allows the contents of the message to be seen:

### Windows native tools

The MSMQ MMC snap-in can be used to manage queues.

Use one of the following based on the OS

```
Start > Run > compmgmt.msc (Computer Management) > Features > Message Queuing
```

or

```
Start > Run > compmgmt.msc (Computer Management) > Services and Applications > Message Queuing
```
