## RabbitMQ management API access is now required

The transport now uses the RabbitMQ management API to [verify broker requirements](/transports/rabbitmq/#broker-compatibility) and enable [delivery limit validation](/transports/rabbitmq/connection-settings.md#delivery-limit-validation).

The [RabbitMQ management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management) must be enabled, and the plugin's [statistics and metrics collection must not be disabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management#disable-stats). See [Configuring RabbitMQ management API access](/transports/rabbitmq/connection-settings.md#configuring-rabbitmq-management-api-access) for configuration options.

## RabbitMQ Client v7 Upgrade

The transport now uses RabbitMQ.Client v7, which exclusively supports an async API model. This change results in some breaking changes in the public API.

For details, see the [RabbitMQ client changelog](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/releases/tag/v7.0.0).

### `IRoutingTopology` Updates

The following changes have been made to `IRoutingTopology`:

- All methods return a [ValueTask](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/understanding-the-whys-whats-and-whens-of-valuetask/).
- The type of the `channel` parameter has been changed from `RabbitMQ.Client.IModel` to `RabbitMQ.Client.IChannel`.
- The type of the `properties` parameter has been changed from `RabbitMQ.Client.IBasicProperties` to `RabbitMQ.Client.BasicProperties`.
- All methods include a [CancellationToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/threading/cancellation-in-managed-threads) as the last parameter.
