SQL Server transport 3.1 introduces native handling of delayed messages. It does so via a dedicated table which holds messages that have been sent but are not yet due. The snippet below shows T-SQL script that creates delayed messages table:

In order to drain all delayed messages sent before upgrading to version 3.1, [Timeout Manager](/nservicebus/messaging/timeout-manager.md) is enabled by default in version 3.1 of the transport. 

As some delayed messages can have the due times months or even years in the future it might be advisable to move the messages manually from the old Timeout Manager storage to the native delayed tables. See the [SQL Server Native Delayed Delivery](/transports/sql/native-delayed-delivery.md) article for more details.


### SQL Server

If SQL Server was used as a backing store for the Timeout Manager, either via [NHibernate persistence](/persistence/nhibernate/) or [SQL persistence](/persistence/sql), refer to [the native timeout migration](/samples/sqltransport/native-timeout-migration/) sample for details. 


### Other databases

If another database was used, use DB-specific tools to extract the `Headers`, `State`, and `Destination` values from the timeout records and export the result to a file.

NOTE: Some persisters, e.g. NHibernate, store all the delayed messages for all the endpoints in a single table. Exporting just the ones for the endpoint that is migrated requires filtering on the `Endpoint` property of the timeout record.

Once exported, use the following script to insert the data into SQL Server transport's table.

NOTE: By default, the table used to store delayed messages has the `Delayed` suffix so for an endpoint called `MyEndpoint` the delayed messages are stored in a table called `MyEndpoint.Delayed`.
