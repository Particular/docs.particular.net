Version 7 of the RabbitMQ transport is focused on fully supporting [quorum queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html).

## Minimum broker version

Version 7 relies on quorum queue features introduced in RabbitMQ 3.10.0, so the transport now requires that all RabbitMQ nodes be on version `3.10.0` or above.

In addition, the `stream_queue` and `quorum_queue` [feature flags](https://www.rabbitmq.com/feature-flags.html) must be enabled.

The broker requirements can be verified with the [`delays verify`](/transports/rabbitmq/operations-scripting.md#delays-verify) command provided by the command line tool.

See the [minimum broker requirements documentation](/transports/rabbitmq/#broker-compatibility) for more details.

## New version of the delay infrastructure

The original v1 delay infrastructure can lose messages due to the [lack of safety guarantees when dead-lettering messages with classic queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html#safety).

Version 7 introduces a new v2 delay infrastructure that uses quorum queues instead of classic queues. The v2 infrastructure can exist side-by-side with the previous v1 infrastructure. Messages in the v1 infrastructure are not automatically migrated, but they can be manually migrated with the [`delays migrate`](/transports/rabbitmq/operations-scripting.md#delays-migrate) command provided in the new command line tool.

## `UseConventionalRoutingTopology` now has a mandatory `QueueType` parameter

To control what type of queue the endpoint will use, a `QueueType` parameter has been added to `UseConventionalRoutingTopology`:

snippet: 6to7conventional

The parameter controls what type of queues the endpoint will create if installers are enabled.

## `UseDirectRoutingTopology` now has a mandatory` QueueType` parameter

To control what type of queue the endpoint will use, a `QueueType` parameter has been added to `UseDirectRoutingTopology`:

snippet: 6to7direct

The parameter controls what type of queues the endpoint will create if installers are enabled.

## Installers no longer ignore queue type mismatches when declaring queues

Now that there is a way to control what sort of queue type is created when installers are enabled, the queue creation installer will once again throw an exception if there is a mismatch between the type of queue it declares and the type of the queue that already exists on the broker.
