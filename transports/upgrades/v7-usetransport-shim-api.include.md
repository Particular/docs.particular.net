Note: The existing API surface with `UseTransport<T>()` is supported for NServiceBus version 8 via a [shim API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)) to ease migration to the new version. However, it is recommended to switch to the new transport configuration API to prepare for future upgrades of NServiceBus.
