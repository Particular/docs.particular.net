## Destination queue creation

Previous versions of the transport automatically created destination queues on send if they weren't available. The automatic creation of destination queues has been removed. Setting up a topology with queues is an operations concern and should happen during the [installation phase](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) of the endpoint or via scripting when provisioning the environment.
