## Delayed delivery

The unrestricted delayed delivery is now always enabled so the `UnrestrictedDurationDelayedDelivery()` API has been deprecated.

## Configuring the SQS transport

To use the SQS transport for NServiceBus, create a new `SqsTransport` instance and pass it to `EndpointConfiguration.UseTransport`.

Instead of:

```csharp
var transport = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport<SqsTransport>();
```

Use:

```csharp
var transport = new SqsTransport();
endpointConfiguration.UseTransport(transport);
```

include: v7-usetransport-shim-api

## SDK clients

In order to pass customized instances of the SQS and SNS SDK clients to the transport use the corresponding `SqsTransport` constructor overload.

## S3 configuration

The S3 usage for large messages is configured via the `S3` property of the transport. By default, the value is `null` which means S3 usage for sending large messages is disabled.

snippet: 5to6-S3

### Encryption

Message payload encryption is configured via the `Encryption` property of the S3 settings object. By default, the value is `null` which means the messages are not encrypted.
