## Configuring the MSMQ transport

To use the MSMQ transport for NServiceBus, create a new instance of `MsmqTransport` and pass it to `EndpointConfiguration.UseTransport`.

Instead of:

```csharp
var transport = endpointConfiguration.UseTransport<MsmqTransport>();
transport.ConnectionString(connectionString);
```

Use:

```csharp
var transport = new MsmqTransport();
endpointConfiguration.UseTransport(transport);
```

include: v7-usetransport-shim-api

## Delayed delivery

Version 2 supports delayed delivery of messages by persisting them in a delayed message store. There is a built-in SQL Server-based store and an extension point for custom stores.

In version 2, explicit configuration is required to enable delayed message delivery. For example:

snippet: delayed-delivery

When upgrading from version 1 to 2, all the existing delayed messages must be migrated using the [timeout migration tool](/nservicebus/tools/migrate-to-native-delivery.md).

## Configuration options

The MSMQ transport configuration options have been moved to the `MsmqTransport` class. See the following table for further information:
