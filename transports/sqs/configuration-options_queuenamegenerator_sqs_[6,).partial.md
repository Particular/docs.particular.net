## Queue name generator

**Optional**

**Default**: `$"{queueNamePrefix}{queueName}` with unsupported characters like `.` are replaced with a hyphen `-`

Provides the ability to override the queue name generation with a custom function that allows creating queues in alignment with custom conventions.

Note: The provided function needs to be _idempotent_, i.e., apply the specified prefix only if it has not been already applied.
