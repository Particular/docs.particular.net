[Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is a message queue service provided by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).


## Advantages and Disadvantages


### Advantages

 * Fully managed turn-key messaging infrastructure. SQS queues requires very little effort to set up, maintain and manage over time.
 * Integrates seamlessly with other services provided by AWS, for example, [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iam/), [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), etc. For organizations already committed to AWS, SQS is a natural choice.
 * Can be used as a gateway between endpoints that may not have direct connectivity to each-other.


### Disadvantages

 * Like other message brokers, there is no local store-and-forward mechanism available. If an endpoint cannot reach SQS, either due to network problems or if SQS is unavailable, the endpoint will not be able to send nor receive messages.
 * Can be relatively expensive when using larger volumes of messages.


## Getting Started


### Set Up An AWS Account

An [AWS IAM](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) account with a pair of [Access Keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-getting-started.html) is required.

The IAM account requires the following: 


#### [SQS permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-api-permissions-reference.html)

 * CreateQueue
 * DeleteMessage
 * DeleteMessageBatch
 * GetQueueUrl
 * ReceiveMessage
 * SendMessage
 * SendMessageBatch
 * SetQueueAttributes
 * ChangeMessageVisibility
 * ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch
 * PurgeQueue


#### [S3 permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html)

 * CreateBucket
 * DeleteObject
 * GetObject
 * PutObject
 * PutLifecycleConfiguration
 * GetLifecycleConfiguration
 * ListAllMyBuckets

By default, [AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) are discovered from environment variables of the machine that is running the endpoint:

 * Access Key ID goes in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
 * Secret Access Key goes in `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Retries and Timeouts


The SQS transport uses the default [retries and timeouts](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/retries-timeouts.html) values implemented by the [AWS SDK for .NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/):

| Parameter          | Default value |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `MaxErrorRetries`  | 4             |
| `RequestTimeout`   | 100s          |
| `ReadWriteTimeout` | 300s          |

NOTE: NServiceBus will perform [immediate](/nservicebus/recoverability/#immediate-retries) and [delayed](/nservicebus/recoverability/#delayed-retries) retries in addition to retries performed internally by the SQS client.
