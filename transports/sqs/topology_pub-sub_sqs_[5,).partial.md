### Publish/Subscribe

The transport is a [multicast-enabled transport](/transports/types.md#multicast-enabled-transports) and provides built-in support for [publish-subscribe messaging](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/) using [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html). Publish and subscribe using SNS and SQS is achieved by publishing a message to a SNS topic to which none or more SQS queues are subscribed, with each SQS queue receiving a copy. The way the NServiceBus SQS transport leverages SNS and SQS, or topology, is by publishing events to the dedicated topics for the event type, with subscribing endpoints creating SNS subscriptions between the topic of events they handle to the endpoint's SQS queue.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, topic names are generated using the [message full type name and replacing characters](configuration-options.md#topic-name-generator) that are not allowed in SNS.

Topology deployment can be automated, or manually created, using the transport CLI tool. Topics and subscriptions are created automatically by the subscribing endpoints. Publishing endpoints must create event topics manually before publishing events if there are no subscribers. Refer to the [transport operations section](/transports/sqs/operations-scripting.md) for more information.

#### Message inheritance support

By default a subscriber will subscribe only to the most concrete type it knows about and a publisher will always publish the most concrete type it knows about. Inheritance at the subscriber level is not supported when using the automatically created topology.

In case a subscriber needs to subscribe to a message type that is not the most concrete type as seen by the publisher, a custom mapping is needed. For example, if a subscriber is subscribed to the `IOrderAccepted` event defined in the `Contracts` assembly it will create and subscribe to a topic named `namespace-IOrderAccepted`. However, if in the same system the publisher publishes the `OrderAccepted` message that implements `IOrderAccepted` from the `Messages` assembly it'll try to publish to the `namespace-OrderAccepted` topic and the message won't be delivered to the desired destination.

For the described inheritance scenario to work properly, a custom mapping must be defined at the subscriber:

snippet: CustomTopicsMappingsTypeToTopicForTopology

The above snippet instructs the subscriber's subscription manager to create and subscribe to a topic named `namespace-OrderAccepted` when subscribing to the `IOrderAccepted` event.

More information about the custom mapping API can be found in the [configuration options](/transports/sqs/configuration-options.md?version=sqs_5#custom-topics-mappings) documentation.

#### Evolving an existing topology

Evolving an existing topology needs to be handled with care. The SQS Transport never deletes any resource so it might happen that messages are routed to undesirable destinations if or when message handlers are moved to a different endpoint, or completely removed.

For instance, in the following scenario:

- The system is composed by a publisher and a scaled-out subscribers (two instances, for the sake of the sample)
- An event needs to be removed as not anymore needed
- The message handler, for the removed event, needs to be removed with no subscribers downtime

The following steps needs to be put in place:

1. Change the publisher first to stop publishing the event for which the handler needs to be removed
1. Deploy the publisher changes
1. Wait for in-flight messages to be consumed
1. Change the subscriber by removing the not anymore needed handler
1. Deploy subscribers instances one-by-one with no downtime
1. Remove the SNS to SQS subscription for the specific event in AWS
1. If not anymore needed, remove the SNS topic for the specific event
