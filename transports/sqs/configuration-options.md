## Retention period

**Optional**

**Default**: 4 days

This is the maximum time that a message will be retained within SQS and S3. When a sent message is not received and successfully processed within the specified time, the message will be lost. This value applies to both SQS and S3 - messages in SQS will be deleted after this amount of time, and large message bodies stored in S3 will automatically be deleted after this amount of time.

The maximum value is 14 days.

**Example**: To set this to the maximum value, specify:

snippet: MaxTTL

NOTE: [Large message payloads stored in S3](topology.md#s3) are never deleted by the receiving endpoint, regardless of whether they were successfully handled. The S3 aging policy controls the deletion of the payload and will respect the configured TTL. Since message payloads stored in S3 are important for audited and failed messages stored in ServiceControl, it is crucial that the [ServiceControl message retention period](/servicecontrol/how-purge-expired-data.md) is aligned with the configured SQS and S3 TTL.

## Queue name prefix

**Optional**

**Default**: None

This string value is prepended to the name of every SQS queue referenced by the endpoint. This is useful when deploying many instances of the same application in the same AWS region (e.g. a development instance, a QA instance, and a production instance), and the queue names must be distinguished from each other.

**Example**: For a development instance, specify:

snippet: QueueNamePrefix

For example, queue names for the endpoint called "SampleEndpoint" might be:

```
DEV-SampleEndpoint
DEV-SampleEndpoint-Retries
DEV-SampleEndpoint-Timeouts
DEV-SampleEndpoint-TimeoutsDispatcher
```

## Offload large messages to S3

**Optional**

**Default**: Disabled. Any attempt to send a message larger than the SQS limit will fail.

This option configures the S3 bucket to be used to store messages larger than 256 kB. If this option is not specified, S3 will not be used at all and any attempt to send a message larger than 256 kB will fail.

If the specified bucket doesn't exist, it will be created when the endpoint starts.

**Example**: To use a bucket named `nsb-sqs-messages`, specify:

snippet: S3BucketForLargeMessages

### Key prefix

**Mandatory**

This is the path within the specified S3 bucket to store large messages.

### S3 Client

**Optional**

**Default**: `new AmazonS3Client()`

By default the transport uses a parameterless constructor to build the S3 client. This overrides the default S3 client with a custom one.

**Example**: To use a custom client, specify:

snippet: S3ClientFactory

#if-version [6.1,)
NOTE: If a custom S3 client is provided, it will not be disposed of when the endpoint is stopped.
#end-if

### Encryption

**Optional**

**Default**: Disabled

Specifies how the large messages stored in S3 are to be encrypted. Default option is no encryption. The alternative is to either use a managed encyption key:

snippet: S3ServerSideEncryption

or to provide a custom key:

snippet: S3ServerSideCustomerEncryption
