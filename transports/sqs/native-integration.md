This document describes how to consume messages from and send messages to non-NServiceBus endpoints via Amazon SQS in integration scenarios.

### Accessing the native Amazon SQS message

It is sometimes useful to access the native Amazon SQS message from behaviors and handlers. When a message is received, the transport adds the native message, an instance of [`Amazon.SQS.Model.Message`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/v3/apidocs/items/SQS/TMessage.html), to the message processing context. For example, the native message may be accessed from a [pipeline behavior](/nservicebus/pipeline/manipulate-with-behaviors.md):

### Message type detection

NServiceBus requires the [the message type](/nservicebus/messaging/message-type-detection.md) to be available as part of the message metadata to process a message successfully.

During message processing, the SQS transport inspects the native message attributes for an attribute with the name `MessageTypeFullName` and a value representing a full type name (i.ex `Sales.OrderAccepted`). If the attribute is present, the message is treated as a native message, and the body is deserialized into the target type represented by `MessageTypeFullName`.

The native message body is loaded from the configured [S3 bucket](/transports/sqs/configuration-options.md#s3bucketforlargemessages) when the message attribute contains an attribute with the key `S3BodyKey` and the value representing an S3 object key, including the [necessary prefix](/transports/sqs/configuration-options.md#s3bucketforlargemessages-s3keyprefix) as configured by the receiving endpoint.

Whenever the native message needs to be copied for [moving messages to the error queue](/nservicebus/recoverability), [auditing](/nservicebus/operations/auditing.md) or [delayed retries](/nservicebus/recoverability/configure-delayed-retries.md) purposes, the native message is converted into the transport's internal structure. The `MessageTypeFullName` and `S3BodyKey` headers are moved from the native message attributes into the [headers collection](/nservicebus/messaging/headers.md). All other available message attributes from the original native message are copied over into the newly formed native message.
