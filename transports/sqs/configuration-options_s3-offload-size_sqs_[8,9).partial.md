This option configures the S3 bucket to be used to store messages larger than 1 MiB for commands and 256KiB for events (_since version 8.1; previous versions support only 256 KiB for both_). If this option is not specified, S3 will not be used at all and any attempt to send a message larger than the size limits will fail.
