## Using connection pool

The SQL Server transport is built on top of [ADO.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/index) and will use connection pooling. This may result in the connection pool being shared by the transport, as well as other parts of the endpoint process and the business logic. 

In scenarios where the concurrent message processing limit is changed, or the database connection is used for other purposes as mentioned above, it is advisable to change the connection pool size to ensure it will not be exhausted. See also [SQL Server Connection Pooling and Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling).

## Connection configuration

Connection string can be configured in several ways:

partial: connection-string


partial: multi-instance


## Custom database schemas

SQL Server transport uses `dbo` as a default schema. Default schema is used for every queue if no other schema is explicitly provided in transport address. That includes all local queues, error, audit and remote queues of other endpoints.

## Circuit Breaker

A built in circuit breaker is used to handle intermittent SQL Server connectivity problems.
