## Format

The SQL Server Transport address has following canonical form

```
table@[schema]@[catalog]
```

include: addressing_parts_3


## Resolution

The address is resolved into a fully-qualified table name that includes table name, its schema and catalog. In the address the table name is the only mandatory part. An address containing only a table name is a valid address e.g. `MyTable`.
