Messages with Time-To-Be-Received (TTBR) specified are pushed through the message pump, just like regular messages, regardless of if their TTBR already elapsed or not. The receive query returns the difference between the expiry time and the current UTC time in the database so that the transport can make a decision if a given message has expired. Calculating the difference on the database level prevents the TTBR feature from being affected by potential clock drift of machines running sender and receiver endpoints.

In addition, expired messages are removed from the queue by a scheduled job which runs every 5 minutes. Each run the job attempts to remove all expired messages, in batches, using `delete` statements. Each batch is limited to 10000 messages.
