WARN: This version of the RabbitMQ transport is using the older v1 version of the delay infrastructure that prefixes the queues and exchanges with `nsb` instead of `nsb.v2`. This version relies on classic queues and can lose messages. The transport should be upgraded to version 7 or later which includes the v2 delay infrastructure based on quorum queues. See the [upgrade guide](/transports/upgrades/rabbitmq-6to7.md#new-version-of-the-delay-infrastructure) for more details.
