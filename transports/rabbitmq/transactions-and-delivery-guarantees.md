## Transport transaction - receive only

When running in `ReceiveOnly` mode, messages are consumed in manual acknowledgment mode. Successfully processed messages are acknowledged via the AMQP [basic.ack](https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html#basic.ack) method, at which point the broker will remove them from the queue. Failed messages that need to be retried are re-queued via the AMQP [basic.reject](https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html#basic.reject) method.

> [!WARNING]
> If the connection to the broker is lost for any reason before a message can be acknowledged, even if the message was successfully processed, the message will automatically be re-queued by the broker. This will result in the endpoint processing the same message multiple times.
