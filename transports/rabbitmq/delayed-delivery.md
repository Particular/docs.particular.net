In Versions 4.3 and above, the RabbitMQ transport no longer relies on the [timeout manager](/nservicebus/messaging/timeout-manager.md) to implement [delayed delivery](/nservicebus/messaging/delayed-delivery.md). Instead, the transport creates infrastructure inside the broker which can delay messages using native RabbitMQ features.


## How it works

When an endpoint is started, the transport declares a set of topic exchanges, queues, and bindings that work together to provide the necessary infrastructure to support delayed messages. Exchanges and queues are grouped to provide 28 delay levels. There is one final delivery exchange in addition to the delay-level exchanges. When a message needs to be delayed, the value of the desired delay is first converted to seconds. The binary representation of this value is used as part of the routing key when the message is sent to the delay-level exchanges. The full routing key has the following format:

```
N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.N.destination
```

Where `N` is either `0` or `1`, representing the delay value in binary, and `destination` is the name of endpoint the delayed message will be sent to.


### Delay levels

Each exchange/queue pair that makes up a level represents one bit of the total delay value. By having 28 of these levels, corresponding to `2^27` through `2^0`, the delay infrastructure can delay a message for any value that can be represented by a 28-bit number. With 28 total levels, the maximum delay value is 268,435,455 seconds, or about 8.5 years.

A delay level is created by declaring a topic exchange that is bound to a queue with a routing key of `1`, and to the exchange corresponding to `level - 1` with a routing key of `0`. The queue for the delay level is declared with an [`x-message-ttl`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ttl.html) value corresponding to `2^level` seconds. The queue is also declared with an [`x-dead-letter-exchange`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html) value corresponding to the `level - 1` exchange, so that when a message in the queue expires, it will be routed to the `level - 1` exchange.

queueN -->|expired<br>message| exchangeN-1

classDef exchangeClass stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px;
class exchangeN,exchangeN-1 exchangeClass

end
```

The delay levels are connected in this manner, from highest (27) to lowest (0). Each delay level's routing key's add wildcards as needed so that they are looking at the portion of the message's routing key that corresponds to its delay level.


### Delivery

The final delay-level exchange is bound to the delivery exchange instead of another delay level. Every endpoint that can receive a delayed message will have a binding to this exchange with a routing key corresponding to the endpoint's name, so the message will be delivered to the endpoint's queue.


### Example

Using a simplified version of the delay infrastructure that has 4 delay levels (0-3), this is an example of sending a message with a delay of 5 seconds to an endpoint called `destination`:

 1. The message is published to the level 3 exchange with the following routing key: (0.1.0.1.destination)
 1. The level 3 bit of the routing key is `0`, so the message is routed to the level 2 exchange. (**0**.1.0.1.destination)
 1. The level 2 bit of the routing key is `1`, so the message is delivered to the level 2 queue. (0.**1**.0.1.destination)
 1. After 4 seconds, the message expires and is routed to the level 1 exchange.
 1. The level 1 bit of the routing key is `0`, so the message is routed to the level 0 exchange. (0.1.**0**.1.destination)
 1. The level 0 bit of the routing key is `1`, so the message is delivered to the level 0 queue. (0.1.0.**1**.destination)
 1. After 1 second, the message expires and is routed to the delivery exchange.
 1. The last part of the routing key is `destination`, so the message is delivered to the endpoint. (0.1.0.1.**destination**)

## Backwards compatibility

When upgrading to a version of the transport that supports delayed delivery natively, it is safe to operate a combination of native-delay and non-native-delay endpoints at the same time. Native endpoints can send delayed messages to endpoints that are not yet aware of the native delay infrastructure. Native endpoints can continue to receive delayed messages from non-native endpoints as well.


### Disabling the timeout manager

To assist with the upgrade process, the timeout manager is still enabled by default, so any delayed messages already stored in the endpoint's persistence database before the upgrade will be sent when their timeouts expire. Any delayed messages sent after the upgrade will be sent through the delay infrastructure even though the timeout manager is enabled.

Once an endpoint has no more delayed messages in its persistence database, there is no more need for the timeout manager. It can be disabled by calling:

snippet: rabbitmq-delay-disable-timeout-manager

At this point, the `.Timeouts` and `.TimeoutsDispatcher` exchanges and queues for the endpoint can be deleted from the broker. In addition, the endpoint no longer requires timeout persistence, so those storage entities can be removed from the persistence database as well.

NOTE: Newly created endpoints that have never been deployed without native delayed delivery should also set this value to prevent the timeout manager from running.
