In order to avoid escalating transaction to DTC when using Entity Framework, the database connection has to be shared. However, sharing the connection string can be problematic when dealing with entities based on the [Entity Framework ADO.Net Data Model (EDMX)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc716685.aspx).

The `DbContext` generated by Entity Framework does not expose a way to inject a simple database connection string. The underlying problem is that Entity Framework requires an `Entity Connection String` that contains more information than a simple connection string.

It is possible to generate a custom a custom `EntityConnection` and inject it into the Entity Framework `DbContext` instance:

snippet: EntityConnectionCreationAndUsage

In the snippet above the `EntityConnectionStringBuilder` class is used to create a valid `Entity Connection String`. Having that a new `EntityConnection` instance can be created.

The `DbContext` generated by default by Entity Framework does not have a constructor that accepts an `EntityConnection` as a parameter. Since it is a partial class that parameter can be added using the following snippet:

snippet: DbContextPartialWithEntityConnection

NOTE: The snippet above assumes that the created entity data model is named `MySample`. The references should match the actual names used in the project.
