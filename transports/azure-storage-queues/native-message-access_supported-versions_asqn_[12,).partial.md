## Access to the native Azure Storage Queues incoming message

Accessing the native azure storage queue's incoming message from behaviors and handlers can be beneficial for customizations and recoverability.  When a message is received, the transport includes the native `QueueMessage` in the message processing context. You can use the following code to retrieve the message details from a pipeline behavior:

snippet: access-native-incoming-message

The above behavior utilizes the native messageâ€™s `NextVisibleOn` property to identify when the message lost its lock due to aggressive prefetching and slow processing. If needed, a [custom recoverability policy](/nservicebus/recoverability/custom-recoverability-policy.md) can be implemented to bypass retry attempts that would inevitably fail because of the lost lock.
