### Using aliases for connection strings to storage accounts

Storage account aliases are enforced by default. The alias is mapped to the physical storage account represented by a `QueueServiceClient` or a connection string (for backward compatibility).

> [!NOTE]
> the default alias is an empty string.

See also [Using aliases instead of connection strings](/transports/azure-storage-queues/multi-storageaccount-support.md#cross-namespace-routing-aliases-instead-of-connection-strings) for multi-account support.
