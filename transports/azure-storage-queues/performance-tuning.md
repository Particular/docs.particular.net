## Parallel Message Retrieval

Multiple parallel read operations are used to improve message throughput. The amount of parallel read operations is the square root of the configured [message processing concurrency](/nservicebus/operations/tuning.md). This value can be increased or decreased if needed by using the `DegreeOfReceiveParallelism` configuration parameter. See [Azure Storage Queues Transport Configuration](/transports/azure-storage-queues/configuration.md) on how to use this parameter.

Note: Changing the value of `DegreeOfReceiveParallelism` will influence the total number of storage operations against Azure Storage Services and can result in higher costs.
