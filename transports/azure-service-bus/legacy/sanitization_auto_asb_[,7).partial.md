All entities treated the same for allowed characters. Only letters, numbers, periods (`.`), hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`) were allowed. Maximum length was predefined by the transport.

In Version 6.4.x [Naming Conventions](/transports/azure-service-bus/legacy/naming-conventions.md) were added to allow custom sanitization of queues, topics, and subscriptions.
