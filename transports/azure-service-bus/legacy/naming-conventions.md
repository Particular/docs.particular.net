## Versions 6 and below


### Naming Conventions

To have a fine-grained control over entity names generated by the ASB transport, the `NamingConventions` class exposes several naming conventions that can be overwritten.

Entity sanitization:

This sanitization allows forward slash `/` in queue and topic names unlike default sanitization convention used by Azure Service Bus transport.

Entities creation:
