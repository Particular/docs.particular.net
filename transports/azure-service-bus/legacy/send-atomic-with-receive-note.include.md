Note: `TransportTransactionMode.SendsAtomicWithReceive` level is only supported in Versions 7 and above of the Azure Service Bus transport. It requires destination and receive queues to be in the same namespace. Also, the transport type must be set to `TransportType.NetMessaging` instead of `TransportType.Amqp`. If the above prerequisites are not given (for example when multiple namespaces are used) the transport transaction mode is automatically lowered to `TransportTransactionMode.ReceiveOnly`.
