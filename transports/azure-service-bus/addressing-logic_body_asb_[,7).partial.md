In Azure Service Bus transport version 6 and below, the *Physical Addressing Logic* implementation makes a number of implicit assumptions regarding names, such as length limitations, legal characters, differences between paths and names, etc. There is no way to explicitly control those settings, and over time subtle variations start to show up.

For example, `Mixed` namespaces allowed paths and names to have up to 290 characters, while `Messaging` namespaces are capped at 260 characters. Moreover, users are sometimes forced to game the system for valid reasons; for example to figure out how to embed slashes (`'/'`) in endpoint names to create sub-directories in the Azure Service Bus namespace registration system.

To mitigate these changes, the transport exposes certain checks as lambda expressions, known as the [naming conventions](/transports/azure-service-bus/naming-conventions.md).
