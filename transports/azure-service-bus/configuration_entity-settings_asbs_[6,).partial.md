### Settings

* `EntityMaximumSize`: The maximum entity size in GB. The value must correspond to a valid value for the namespace type. Defaults to 5. See [the Microsoft documentation on quotas and limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quotas) for valid values.
* `EnablePartitioning`: Partitioned entities offer higher availability, reliability, and throughput over conventional non-partitioned queues and topics. For more information about partitioned entities [see the Microsoft documentation on partitioned messaging entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-partitioning).
* `AutoDeleteOnIdle`: A `TimeSpan` representing the [AutoDeleteOnIdle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/advanced-features-overview#autodelete-on-idle) setting for instance-specific input queues (such as when using [`MakeInstanceUniquelyAddressable`](/nservicebus/messaging/routing.md#make-instance-uniquely-addressable)) created by the transport. This value is the maximum time period that a queue can remain [idle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-expiration#idleness) before Azure Service Bus automatically deletes it. Defaults to `TimeSpan.MaxValue` in Azure Service Bus if this setting is not specified within the transport. The minimum allowed value is 5 minutes. The transport will not apply this setting to topics or subscriptions as these are considered shared infrastructure (along with shared queues such as error and audit).
* `HierarchyNamespaceOptions`: A `HierarchyNamespaceOptions` representing options for controlling hierarchical entities. Azure Service Bus [allows entities to be organized in hierarchies on the same namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/servicebus/addressing-and-protocol). In a multi-tenant environment, this can be used to group tenant related queues and topics. It can also be used to separate work done by different developers (in non-production environments), separate production and lower environments, or to create a temporary infrastructure for troubleshooting a bug.
  * `HierarchyNamespace`: The hierarchy namespace to be used for entity path prefixing using the format `{HierarchyNamespace}/{entity}`. Available to get through `MessageTypeFullNamesToExclude`.
  * A list of message types to be excluded from the hierarchy namespace application. For messages of those types, the `HierarchyNamespace` prefix will not be applied, so they will be sent to `{entity}` instead. The types to be excluded are added through `ExcludeMessageType` or `ExcludeMessageTypes` methods
