When messages are received using `PeekLock` mode, the receive operation becomes a two-stage operation. The first stage, the message is locked by the broker for a specific consumer for a fixed period known as `LockDuration`. When the consumer is done with the message, the message is marked as completed by the consumer, indicating to the broker that second stage is finished. Default lock duration for the Azure Service Bus transport is set to 30 seconds. Maximum lock duration allowed by the broker service is 5 minutes. `LockDuration` is a global setting that is applied to all entities.

Occasionally, processing can take longer than the maximum allowed time for `LockDuration`. As a result of that, messages will re-appear on the queue and will be available to other consumers. Azure Service Bus transport version 7 and above supports automatic message lock renewal.


## How message lock renewal works

Message lock renewal is only applied on messages actively processed by endpoints and is not applicable to the prefetched messages.

Message lock renewal should be greater than `LockDuration`. When `LockDuration` period is due to expire, Azure Service Bus transport will issue lock renewal request to the broker, keeping message locked and invisible to other consumers. Lock renewal will automatically take place while the total time of the message processing stays less than auto renewal time set by Azure Service Bus transport. The default lock renewal time is 5 minutes. Auto lock renewal will **not** increase `DeliveryCount` of the processed message.

Message lock renewal applies to the currently processed message. Prefetched messages not handled within the `LockDuration` time will lose their lock, indicated with a `LockLostException` in the log when they are completed by the transport. To prevent the exception with lock renewal prefetching can be disabled by setting `PrefetchCount` to zero.

## Configuring message lock renewal

The configuration of message lock renewal is done on `MessageReceivers` extension of the transport, specifying the maximum period lock renewal should take place.

For example, setting lock renewal time to 10 minutes and `LockDuration` set to 1 minute will ensure that message will remain locked for at most 10 minutes, but not past that. If message processing exceeds the 10 minutes, the message will become available to other consumers.
