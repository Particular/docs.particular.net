## Access to the native Azure Service Bus incoming message

It can sometimes be useful to access the native Service Bus incoming message from behaviors and handlers. When a message is received, the transport adds the native Service Bus [`Message`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.servicebus.message) to the message processing context. Use the code below to access the message details from a [pipeline behavior](/nservicebus/pipeline/manipulate-with-behaviors.md):

snippet: access-native-incoming-message

The behavior above uses the native message's `LockedUntilUtc` system property to determine where the message lost its lock as a result of aggressive prefetching and slow processing. The message with the lost lock will not go through [the recoverability process](/nservicebus/recoverability/), skipping attempted processing that otherwise would be guaranteed to fail due to the message's lost lock.

## Access to the native Azure Service Bus outgoing message

It can also be useful to access the native Service Bus outgoing message from behaviors and handlers for customizations.
