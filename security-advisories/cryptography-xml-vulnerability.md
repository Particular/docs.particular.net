title: Security Advisory 2022-12-06
summary: System.Security.Cryptography.Xml vulnerability (CVE-2022-34716) in NServiceBus
reviewed: 2025-03-21
---

This advisory discloses a security vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized access of privileged information by exploiting [a vulnerability in `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` 4.7.0](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/232). Some earlier versions of NServiceBus had a package dependency on `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` with a minimum required version of 4.7.0, and projects referencing those versions of NServiceBus inherited the vulnerability. The vulnerability has been removed in patches for those versions of [NServiceBus](/nservicebus/) by changing the minimum required version of `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to 4.7.1.

Projects are affected by this vulnerability if both of the following are true:

- They reference NServiceBus 7.7.x (7.7.4 or earlier) or 7.8.0 (other versions may be affected, but they are [not supported](/nservicebus/upgrades/supported-versions.md#nservicebus))
- They do not explicitly reference `<PackageReference Include="System.Security.Cryptography.Xml" Version="4.7.1" />` or later

Questions or concerns regarding this advisory may be sent to [security@particular.net](mailto://security@particular.net).
