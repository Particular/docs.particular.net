This advisory discloses a security vulnerability that has been found in NServiceBus and fixed in a recently released hotfix.

 * All endpoints should be upgraded to the latest version of the NServiceBus package to fix this vulnerability if:
   * using the NServiceBus [MSMQ transport](/transports/msmq),
   * running the NServiceBus [installers](/nservicebus/operations/installers.md) to provision endpoints,
   * message queue access rights for Anonymous and Everyone accounts have been manually removed.

This advisory affects all versions of the NServiceBus up to and including 5.2.19 and 6.0.2.


## Vulnerability: installers change permissions on existing MSMQ queues

A vulnerability has been fixed that allows attackers to grant Anonymous and Everyone accounts access to existing MSMQ queues by enforcing an endpoint restart.


## Impact

Attackers can use this vulnerability to:

 * send unauthorized messages to MSMQ queues managed by NServiceBus,
 * peek and receive messages from MSMQ queues managed by NServiceBus.


## Exploitability

The exploitation of this vulnerability requires that all of the conditions below are met at the same time the attacker must be able to:

 1. Enforce an endpoint restart or detect that an endpoint has been restarted,
 1. Access MSMQ queues managed by the restarted endpoint using an Anonymous or Everyone account.


## Affected versions

All versions of NServiceBus, up to and including 5.2.19 and 6.0.2, are affected by this vulnerability. The issue is tracked in https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/4266.


## Risk Mitigation

If it is not possible to upgrade all endpoints that are using the affected version of NServiceBus, the following can be used as a **risk mitigation**:

 * Configure [MSMQ auditing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms705046.aspx) for queues managed by NServiceBus and monitor the [security log](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731826.aspx) for unauthorized access.


## Fix

This vulnerability can be fixed by upgrading the NServiceBus package. Upgrades should be performed as follows:


### Version 5.x users should upgrade to Version 5.2.20 or higher.

**Option 1: Full update**

Update the NuGet package using `Update-Package NServiceBus`, re-compile the endpoint/application, and redeploy the endpoint/application.

**Option 2: In-place update**

Update the NuGet package using `Update-Package NServiceBus`, stop affected endpoints, copy the new `NServiceBus.Core.dll` assembly, overwriting the one(s) currently deployed for the endpoints, and restart the affected endpoints.


### Version 6.x users should upgrade to Version 6.0.3 or higher

**Option 1 Full update**

Update the NuGet package using `Update-Package NServiceBus`, re-compile the endpoint/application, and redeploy the endpoint/application.

**Option 2  In-place update**

Update the NuGet package using `Update-Package NServiceBus`, stop affected endpoints, copy the new `NServiceBus.Core.dll` assembly, overwriting the one(s) currently deployed for the endpoints, and restart the affected endpoints.
