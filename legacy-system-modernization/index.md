Legacy system modernization is an ongoing challenge: today's modern systems are tomorrow's legacy.

## The journey

Modernizing a legacy .NET system is not a one-time event — it’s a journey. The [Particular Service Platform](/platform/) with [NServiceBus](/nservicebus/) enables that journey to proceed safely, incrementally, and successfully.

This section demonstrates how it can guide and support each step of a typical modernization journey.

### Step 1: Begin the "strangle"

Modernization often starts with identifying a small piece of functionality to extract. New services can be built around the legacy system resulting in [hybrid solutions](/architecture/hybrid-systems.md).

### Step 2: Introduce asynchronous messaging

Messaging patterns offer a more flexible, reliable and less disruptive way to connect a legacy system to a new one, especially when handling data format differences and gradual migrations.

Furthermore, asynchronous messaging enables old and new components to communicate reliably, without tight coupling.

[NServiceBus](/nservicebus) simplifies building distributed systems by providing a messaging framework that abstracts away the complexities of message queues, enhancing scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
It includes first-class support for [modern architecture concepts](/architecture/#concepts) like [pub/sub](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/) and [sagas](/nservicebus/sagas/), helping teams coordinate complex workflows and build event-driven systems with minimal boilerplate.

### Step 3: Bridge the gap

As more services come online, system communication becomes essential.

The [native integration](./native-integration.md) and [messaging bridge](./messaging-bridge.md) features of NServiceBus allow new services to evolve independently while maintaining seamless interactions with the legacy system, even if they use different brokers ([transports](/transports/)) or architectures.

### Step 4: Ensure data integrity

Legacy applications often rely on distributed transactions to keep data consistent. NServiceBus provides features that help to move away from MSDTC while [ensuring data integrity](./transactional-session-and-outbox.md).

### Step 5: System monitoring

Organizations must monitor their systems and have the ability to gracefully recover from errors, as failure to do so can lead to significant operational, financial, and reputational risks.

The Particular Platform provides tools to effectively handle [system management](./system-monitoring-and-management.md).

### Step 6: Support

Knowing that [expert support](./support.md) is available throughout the legacy system modernization journey provides peace of mind and allows developers to focus on other aspects of their business.
