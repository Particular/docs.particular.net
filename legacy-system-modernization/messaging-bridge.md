The [NServiceBus Messaging Bridge](/nservicebus/bridge) allows NServiceBus endpoints to connect to other endpoints that are not using the same transport using the [Messaging Bridge Pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/MessagingBridge.html).

It facilitates modernizing in stages resulting in [hybrid systems](/architecture/hybrid-systems.md) which have components running both in the cloud and on-premises.
