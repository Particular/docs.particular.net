Previews allow Particular Software to develop new features more quickly while better addressing user needs.

Before deciding to launch a preview, a research process is undertaken to determine which features best address the needs of users to help ensure the success of a preview.

Previews typically run for some period of time and their success is determined by customer adoption. If successful, it will translate into the adoption into the platform. Previews that are insufficiently used in production will be converted into a [community project](support-policy.md).

During a preview, user feedback is central, so the more feedback is received, the better the end result will be.
