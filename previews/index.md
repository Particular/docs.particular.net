Previews allow Particular Software to develop new features more quickly while better addressing user needs.

Before deciding to launch a Preview, a research process is undertaken to determine which features best address the needs of users to help ensure the success of a Preview.

Previews typically run for some period of time and their success is determined by customer adoption. If successful, it will translate into the adoption into the Platform. Previews that are insufficiently used in production will be converted into a community project.

During a Preview, user feedback is central, so the more feedback is received, the better the end result. 

## Upcoming Previews

The following Preview(s) are under initial development and will be available soon for anyone to use:

* Azure Functions support in NServiceBus

## Available to use

* No Previews are currently available for testing

## Support

Previews enjoy similar support as the rest of the platform. For that reason we encourage everyone to try and use them in production. [Read more about the support policy for previews here](~/previews/support-policy.md~).
