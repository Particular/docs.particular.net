When a system is broken down into multiple processes - each with its own queue - it allows identifying which process is the bottleneck by examining how many messages (on average) are in each queue. However, it is not possible to know how long messages are waiting in each queue - which is the primary indicator of a bottleneck - without knowing the rate of messages coming into each queue, and the rate at which messages are being processed from each queue.

> The NServiceBus.Metrics.PerformanceCounters package is only available for Windows. Newer projects may benefit more from monitoring via [OpenTelemetry](/nservicebus/operations/opentelemetry.md).

The Windows Performance Counters package provides additional performance counters to better understand how long it takes for messages to flow through queues, not just the number of messages in the queue.

Since all performance counters in Windows are exposed via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), it is very straightforward to pull this information into the existing monitoring infrastructure.
