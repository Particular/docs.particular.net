### Target Frameworks

Samples can be targeted to multiple [target frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks). Samples can be edited and tested for multiple frameworks within this repository when using Visual Studio. When the site is rendered, separate downloads for each target framework are generated by splitting the framework list and transforming the project files before zipping.

When multi-targeting samples for NServiceBus 8 and earlier, The recommended set of frameworks is:

```xml
<TargetFrameworks>net8.0;net48</TargetFrameworks>
```

For NServiceBus 9, samples can't currently be multi-targeted, so they should be singled targeted:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
```

Some things to keep in mind:

* The same list of target frameworks must be used for each project, **in the same order**.
* Target framework monikers (i.e. `net8.0`) are translated to framework display names (i.e. `.NET 8`) in [/components/tfm-mappings.txt](https://github.com/Particular/docs.particular.net/blob/master/components/tfm-mappings.txt).
    * Download dropdown items are ordered by position in this file descending, so that options for newer frameworks are presented first.
