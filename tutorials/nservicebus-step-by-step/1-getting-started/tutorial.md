In this first lesson, which should take 10-15 minutes, you will create your first messaging endpoint.

## Exercise

Let's build something simple to give NServiceBus a try.

This tutorial uses NServiceBus version 8, .NET 6, and assumes an up-to-date installation of [Visual Studio 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

> [!NOTE]
> NServiceBus 8 also [supports .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher](/nservicebus/operations/dotnet-framework-version-requirements.md), but [new applications should be built on .NET 6 or higher](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/).

### Create a solution

First, let's create a basic solution and include the dependencies we need.

 1. In Visual Studio, create a new project and select the **Console App** project type.
 2. Select **.NET 6.0 (Long Term Support)** from the Framework dropdown.
 3. Set the project name to **ClientUI**.
 4. Set the solution name to **RetailDemo**.

Next, add the NServiceBus NuGet package as a dependency. Using PowerShell or another terminal alternative, navigate to the ClientUI project directory and run the following command:

```
dotnet add package NServiceBus
```

This adds an NServiceBus.Core assembly reference to the ClientUI project. Now we're ready to start writing code.

### Configure an endpoint

We're ready to create a [**messaging endpoint**](/nservicebus/endpoints/). A messaging endpoint (or just **endpoint**) is a logical component capable of sending and receiving messages. An endpoint is hosted within a process, which in this case is a simple console application, but could be a web application or other .NET process.

In the **Program.cs** file, modify the code to look like the following:

snippet: EmptyProgram

> [!NOTE]
> For the sake of brevity, code snippets in this tutorial do not contain the `using` statements needed to import namespaces. 
> If you're using Visual Studio, unknown references such as `Task` or NServiceBus types will generate a "red squiggly" underline effect. 
> If you hover or click on the red squiggly, you can click on the "light bulb" icon or press <span style="white-space: nowrap"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd></span> to see the available fixes and insert the appropriate `using` statements for the missing namespaces.
>
> Alternatively, in the code snippet's **Copy/Edit** menu you will find a **Copy usings** item that will copy the namespaces used by the snippet to your clipboard.

Now that we have a `Main` method, let's discuss the importance of each line we're going to add to it. First, add the following code to the `Main` method:

snippet: Main

Now, let's go line-by-line and find out exactly what each step is doing.

#### Console Title

snippet: ConsoleTitle

When running multiple console apps in the same solution, giving each one a name makes them easier to identify. This console app's title is `ClientUI`. In later lessons, we'll expand this solution to host multiple applications.

#### EndpointConfiguration

snippet: EndpointName

The `EndpointConfiguration` class is where we define all the settings that determine how our endpoint will operate. The single string parameter `ClientUI` is the [**endpoint name**](/nservicebus/endpoints/specify-endpoint-name.md), which serves as the logical identifier for our endpoint, and forms a naming convention by which other components will derive their names, such as the **input queue** where the endpoint will listen for messages to process.
When setting up the endpoint configuration you can choose how you want to serialize your messages. For this tutorial, we will be configuring the endpoint to use `SystemJsonSerializer` which uses the .NET `System.Text.Json` serializer.

#### Transport

snippet: LearningTransport

This setting defines the [**transport**](/transports/) that NServiceBus will use to send and receive messages. We are using the [Learning transport](/transports/learning/), which is bundled in the NServiceBus.Core library as a starter transport for learning how to use NServiceBus without additional dependencies. All other transports are provided using different NuGet packages.

Capturing the `transport` settings in a variable as shown will make things easier in [a later lesson](../3-multiple-endpoints/) when we start defining message routing rules.

### Starting up

At the end of the `Main` method, after the configuration code, add the following lines which will start the endpoint and keep it running until you press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to shut it down.

snippet: Startup

The endpoint is initialized according to the settings defined by the `EndpointConfiguration` class. Once the endpoint starts, any changes made to the configuration won't be applied until you restart the endpoint.

When you run the endpoint for the first time, the endpoint will:

 * Display its logging information, which is [written to a file, Trace, and the Console](/nservicebus/logging/#default-logging). NServiceBus also logs to multiple levels, so you can [change the log level](/nservicebus/logging/#default-logging-changing-the-defaults-changing-the-logging-level) from `INFO` to `DEBUG` in order to get more information.
 * Display the [status of your license](/nservicebus/licensing/).
 * Attempt to add the current user to the "Performance Monitor Users" group so that it can write [performance counters](/monitoring/metrics/performance-counters.md) to track its health and progress.
 * Create file-based "queues" in the `.learningtransport` directory inside your solution directory. We recommend adding `.learningtransport` to your source control system's ignore file.

## Summary

In this lesson, we created a simple messaging endpoint to make sure it works. In the next lesson, we'll define a message and a message handler, then send the message and watch it get processed.
