The best way to get started with NServiceBus is to use it to build something realistic. In doing so, you'll learn the architectural concepts behind the software and start to learn its capabilities. In this tutorial, you'll build a back-end for a retail e-commerce system. You'll learn how to send asynchronous messages between processes, how to use the publish/subscribe pattern to decouple business processes, and the advantages of using reliable messaging to enable automatic retries after processing failures.

NOTE: If you're not quite ready for a deep dive, and just need to get a sense of what NServiceBus can do for you, check out our [Quick Start tutorial](/tutorials/quickstart/) instead.

The tutorial is divided into five lessons, each of which can be accomplished in a half hour or less — perfect for your lunch break.
