The downloadable solution will go in this folder.

It should:
- Resemble the sample in the NServiceBus 101 tutorial
- Run on the Learning Transport and Persistence
- Contain endpoints from all currently supported major versions (v5, v6, and v7)

Outstanding questions:
- Should the endpoints already be configured to send data to Particular.Monitoring?
  - If so, should this configuration be commented out?
