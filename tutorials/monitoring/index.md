## Overview

- **[Lesson 0: Setting up sample solution](0-sample-solution/)** - download and set up a sample solution that can be used for the rest of this tutorial. 

- **[Lesson 1: Component overview](1-component-overview/)** - learn about all of the monitoring components in the Particular Service Platform.

- **[Lesson 2: Setting up monitoring environment](2-setting-up-environment/)**  - learn how set up all of the server side monitoring components of the Particular Service Platform.

- **[Lesson 3: Configuring endpoints](3-configuring-endpoints/)** - learn how to configure endpoints to send monitoring data to the Particular Service Platform.

- **Lesson 4: Throughput and processing time** - learn how to measure individual endpoint performance by examining message throughput and processing time.

- **Lesson 5: Queue length and critical time** - learn how to measure inter-endpoint performance by examining queue length and critical time.

- **Lesson 6: Failure rates** - learn how to detect hidden problems in your solution by watching failure rates.
