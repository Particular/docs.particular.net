title: "NServiceBus 101 Lesson 2: Sending a command"
component: Core
---

Sending and receiving messages is the heart and soul of any NServiceBus system. The fact that we are dealing with systems and not applications is the whole reason we send messages in the first place.

An **application** has a single executable and runs on a single machine, like Microsoft Word. An application doesn't usually has a single source of information, and doesn't really have to think about connectivity. If you try to save a file to a network share and the volume isn't available, it just throws and error and makes you, the user, deal with it.

A **system**, on the other hand, can be made up of multiple executables on multiple machines, and usually has multiple sources of information. A system must deal with connectivity constantly. A system is not an application, and furthermore, each executable within a system is not an application either. All must deal with connectivity on a constant basis.

This is why an NServiceBus system will send messages, so that individual executables can communicate with each other in a reliable way. If there's a connectivity problem between executables, messages store the communication in a reliable way so that the executable on the receiving end can receive the message when it is able to do so.


## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will have learned:

* How to define messages
* How to define message handlers
* How to send and receive a message locally
* How to use NServiceBus's logging capabilities


## What is a message?

A **message** is a collection of data sent via one-way communication between two endpoints. In NServiceBus, we define a message via a POCO – a Plain Old C# Object.

In this lesson, we're going to be focusing on the simpler type of message: commands. In [Lesson 4: Publishing events](../lesson-4/) we'll expand to look at events as well.

Defining a command is pretty easy. We just create a class and mark it with the `ICommand` marker interface.

    public class DoSomething : ICommand
    {
        public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    }

The marker interface has no implementation, but lets NServiceBus know that the class is a command so that it can build up some metadata about the message type when the endpoint starts up. Any properties you create within the message constitute the message data.

The name of the command class is also important. A command is an order to do something, so it should be named in the [imperative tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood). `PlaceOrder`, `UpdateCustomerStatus`, and `ChargeCreditCard` are all great names for commands, because they are phrased as a command and are very specific. You can easily guess exactly what each of those messages will do. `UserMessage`, on the other hand, is not a good example. It is not in the imperative, and it's not very specific either. Another developer should know exactly what a command's purpose is just by reading the name.

When sending a message, the endpoint's message serializer will serialize an instance of the `DoSomething` class (let's say to JSON) and add that to the contents of the outgoing message that goes to the queue. On the other end, the receiving endpoint will deserialize the message from JSON back to an instance of the message class so that it can be used in code.

Messages can support whatever data the serializer can successfully process. Thus messages can even contain child objects or collections.

    public class DoSomethingComplex : ICommand
    {
        public int SomeId { get; set; }
        public ChildClass ChildStuff { get; set; }
        public List<ChildClass> ListOfStuff { get; set; }
        
        public DoSomethingComplex()
        {
            // Nobody likes dealing with null collections
            ListOfStuff = new List<ChildClass>();
        }
    }
    
    public class ChildClass
    {
        public string SomeProperty { get; set; }
    }

While it can be pretty tempting to throw in the kitchen sink, consider that messages are a contract between two endpoints. Any change to the message will likely involve a change on both the sender and receiver side. The more properties you have on a message, the more reasons it has to change, so keep your messages as slim as possible.

Also, you should not embed logic within your NServiceBus message classes. Each message should only contain only automatic properties and not computed properties or methods. However, it is a good practice to instantiate collection properties from a default parameterless constructor as shown above, so that you never have to deal with a potentially null collection.

In essence, messages should be carriers for data only. This way, discovering a bug in logic will not require redeployment of every endpoint that uses a message.


## How do I organize messages?

Because messages must be shared between multiple endpoints, you can't put the classes in the same assembly with the endpoints. They need to live in a separate class library so that they can be referenced by multiple endpoints.

A **message assembly** should contain only NServiceBus message contracts, and any supporting types required by the messages themselves. For example, a message may use an enumeration type for one of its properties; that enumeration should also live within the same message assembly.

Message assemblies should be entirely self-contained. They should have no dependencies other than libraries included with the .NET Framework, and the NServiceBus core assembly, which is required to reference the `ICommand` interface. Limiting dependencies makes your message contracts more resilient to future changes in the system.

> In another course, we'll learn how (and why) to use [message conventions](/nservicebus/messaging/conventions.md) to identify message types, rather than the `ICommand` interface. Then we don't even need to reference the NServiceBus assembly in our message assemblies, but we'll leave that out of scope for now.


## How do I process a message?

To process a message, we create a **message handler**, a class that implements `IHandleMessages<T>`, where `T` is a message type. A message handler looks like this:

    public class DoSomethingHandler : IHandleMessages<DoSomething>
    {
        public Task Handle(DoSomething message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            // Do something with the message here!
        }
    }

The implementation of the `IHandleMessages<T>` interface is the `Handle` method, which NServiceBus will invoke when a matching message (in this case `DoSomething`) arrives. The message handling method receives an instance of the message, as well as an `IMessageHandlerContext` instance that contains the messaging tools (sending messages, etc.) that can be used within a message handler.

True to the asynchronous nature of NServiceBus, the `Handle` method returns a `Task` that you must return – returning `null` instead will result in an exception. (In the example above, the lack of a return statement would be a compiler error.)

If all of the operations within the message handler are synchronous, you can simply return `Task.CompletedTask` if using .NET 4.6 or greater, or `Task.FromResult(false)` if `CompletedTask` is not available.

    public class DoSomethingHandler : IHandleMessages<DoSomething>
    {
        public Task Handle(DoSomething message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Got the message!");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }

If you plan to call asynchronous operations within the message handler, you can add the `async` keyword to the method, and then await any tasks needed. Then no explicit return is needed because the compiler generates it for you as part of the async state machine.

    public class DoSomethingHandler : IHandleMessages<DoSomething>
    {
        public async Task Handle(DoSomething message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            await SomeOperationAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
            await SomeOperationAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }

You can even implement `IHandleMessages<T>` for multiple different message types within the same class, if it makes sense to logically group the handlers together. Just don't expect any state in class variables to be persisted. NServiceBus will create a new instance of the class for every message that it handles.

    public class DoSomethingHandler : IHandleMessages<DoSomething>,
        IHandleMessages<DoSomethingElse>
    {
        public Task Handle(DoSomething message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Received DoSomething");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
        
        public Task Handle(DoSomethingElse message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Received DoSomethingElse");
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }

When NServiceBus starts up, it will find all of these message handler classes and automatically wire them up, so that they will be invoked when messages arrive. There's no special setup or configuration needed.


## Exercise

Now let's take the "Hello world" solution we started in the last lesson and modify it to send a message. You can also grab the [completed solution from the last lesson](https://github.com/Particular/docs.particular.net/tree/academy-nsb101/tutorials/nservicebus-101/lesson-1/solution/) to use as a starting point.

When we're done, the ClientUI endpoint will be sending a PlaceOrder message to itself, and then processing that message, as depicted in the following diagram:

![Exercise 2 Diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/427110/16881730/2cc36e02-4a81-11e6-9580-b2b9bab61bc0.png)


### Create a messages assembly

Messages should be self-contained within a separate assembly so that they can be shared between endpoints, so let's create that assembly now.

1. In the solution, create a new project and select the **Class Library** project type.
2. Set the name of the project to **Messages**.
3. Remove the automatically created **Class1.cs** file from the project. We would prefer to have our messages a little more organized than files in the root of the project. (More on this a little later.)
4. In the **ClientUI** project, add a reference to the **Messages** project.


### Create a message

In order to better organize messages, we'll create our first command in a folder called **Commands**.

> NOTE: Because of Visual Studio's automatic namespace conventions, this will make the namespace of any class we create in this folder `Messages.Commands`, which will help later on when we want to apply [message conventions](/nservicebus/messaging/conventions.md) to identify messages instead of marker interfaces.

1. In the **Messages** project, create a new folder called **Commands**.
2. In the **Commands** folder, add a new class named `PlaceOrder`.
3. Mark `PlaceOrder` as `public` and implement `ICommand`.
    > NOTE: The .NET Framework contains another interface named `ICommand` in the `System.Windows.Input` namespace. Be sure that if you use tooling to resolve the namespace, you select `NServiceBus.ICommand`. Most of the types you will need will reside in the `NServiceBus` namespace.
4. Add a public property of type `string` named `OrderId`.

When complete, your `PlaceOrder` class should look like the following:

    namespace Messages.Commands
    {
        public class PlaceOrder : ICommand
        {
            public string OrderId { get; set; }
        }
    }


### Create a handler

Now that we've defined a message, we can create a message handler to handle it. Rather than create a new endpoint, let's start by just handling the message locally within the **ClientUI** endpoint.

1. In the **ClientUI** project, create a new class named `PlaceOrderHandler`.
2. Mark the handler class as public, and implement the `IHandleMessages<PlaceOrder>` interface.
3. Add a logger instance, which will allow you to take advantage of the same logging system used by NServiceBus. This has an important advantage over `Console.WriteLine()`: the messages you write with the logger will be written to the log file in addition to the console. Use this code to add the logger instance to your handler class:
    ```
    private ILog logger = LogManager.GetLogger<PlaceOrderHandler>();
    ```
4. Within the `Handle` method, use the logger to record the receipt of the `PlaceOrder` message, including the value of the `OrderId` message property:
    ```
    logger.Info($"Received PlaceOrder, OrderId = {message.OrderId}");
    ```
5. Since everything we have done in this handler method is synchronous, return `Task.CompletedTask`.

When complete, your `PlaceOrderHandler` class should look like this:

```
public class PlaceOrderHandler : IHandleMessages<PlaceOrder>
{
    private ILog logger = LogManager.GetLogger<PlaceOrderHandler>();

    public Task Handle(PlaceOrder message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
    {
        logger.Info($"Received PlaceOrder, OrderId = {message.OrderId}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```


### Send a message locally

Now we have a message and a handler to process it. Let's send that message!

In the **ClientUI** project, we are currently stopping the endpoint when we press the Enter key. Instead, let's create a run loop that will allow us to be a little more interactive, so that we can use the keyboard to decide whether to send a message or quit.

Add the following method to the **Program.cs** file:

    static async Task RunLoop(IEndpointInstance endpointInstance)
    {
        var logger = LogManager.GetLogger<Program>();

        while (true)
        {
            logger.Info("Enter 'placeorder' to place an order, or 'quit' to quit.");
            string input = Console.ReadLine();

            switch (input?.ToLower())
            {
                case "placeorder":
                    // Instantiate the command
                    var command = new PlaceOrder { OrderId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() };

                    // Send the command to the current
                    logger.Info($"Sending PlaceOrder command, OrderId = {command.OrderId}");
                    await endpointInstance.SendLocal(command).ConfigureAwait(false);
                    
                    break;

                case "quit":
                    return;

                default:
                    logger.Info("Unknown input. Please try again.");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
 
Let's take a closer look at the case when we want to place an order. Since the `PlaceOrder` command is just a class, we can instantiate it normally, supplying a unique value for the `OrderId`. Then, after logging the details, we can send it with the `SendLocal` method.

    case "placeorder":
        // Instantiate the command
        var command = new PlaceOrder { OrderId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() };

        // Send the command to the current
        logger.Info($"Sending PlaceOrder command, OrderId = {command.OrderId}");
        await endpointInstance.SendLocal(command).ConfigureAwait(false);
        
        break;
    
`SendLocal(object message)` is a method that is available on the `IEndpointInstance` interface, as we are using here, and also on the `IMessageHandlerContext` interface, which we saw when we were defining our message handler. The *Local* part means that we are not sending to an external endpoint (in a different process) so we intend to handle the message in the same endpoint that sent it. Using `SendLocal()`, we don't have to specify any mappings to tell the message where to go.

Because `SendLocal()` returns a `Task`, we need to be sure to `await` it properly.
 
In order to use our `RunLoop` method, we need to replace the previous Console operations with a call to the new method in the `AsyncMain` method:

    var endpointInstance = await Endpoint.Start(endpointConfig).ConfigureAwait(false);

    // Remove these two lines
    Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to exit...");
    Console.ReadLine();
    
    // Replace with:
    await RunLoop(endpointInstance);

    await endpointInstance.Stop().ConfigureAwait(false);

> Note: Although we're calling `SendLocal()` from the endpoint instance, this method (and others such as `Send()`, `Publish()`, etc.) is also available from the `IMessageHandlerContext` that gets passed in to a message handler's `Handle()` method.


### Running the solution

Now we can run the solution. Whenever we type `placeorder` on the console, a command message is sent and then processed by a handler class in the same project.

    INFO  ClientUI.Program Enter 'placeorder' to place an order, or 'quit' to quit.
    placeorder
    INFO  ClientUI.Program Sending PlaceOrder command, OrderId = 1ec12713-f86d-43e1-a41f-16aba19dd6f7
    INFO  ClientUI.Program Enter 'placeorder' to place an order, or 'quit' to quit.
    INFO  ClientUI.PlaceOrderHandler Received PlaceOrder, OrderId = 1ec12713-f86d-43e1-a41f-16aba19dd6f7
    placeorder
    INFO  ClientUI.Program Sending PlaceOrder command, OrderId = 9260d6ce-6f3e-4b00-9edb-0dfb905afee8
    INFO  ClientUI.Program Enter 'placeorder' to place an order, or 'quit' to quit.
    INFO  ClientUI.PlaceOrderHandler Received PlaceOrder, OrderId = 9260d6ce-6f3e-4b00-9edb-0dfb905afee8

Note how after sending a message, the prompt from `ClientUI.Program` is displayed before the `ClientUI.PlaceOrderHandler` acknowledges receipt of the message. This is because, rather than calling the `Handle` method as a direct method call, the message is sent asynchronously, and then control immediately returns to the `RunLoop`, which repeats the prompt. It isn't until a bit later, when the message is received and processed, that we see the `Received PlaceOrder` notification.


## Summary

In this lesson we learned about messages, message assemblies, and message handlers. We created a message and a handler and we used `SendLocal()` to essentially send the message to ourselves.

In the next lesson, we'll create a second messaging endpoint, move our message handler over to it, and then configure the ClientUI to send the message to the new endpoint. We'll also be able to observe what happens when we send messages while the receiver endpoint is offline.

Before moving on, you might want to check your code against the completed solution (below) to see if there's anything you may have missed.

When you're ready, move on to [**Lesson 3: Managing multiple endpoints**](../lesson-3/).
