## NServiceBus sagas: Getting started

In the [Introduction to NServiceBus](/tutorials/intro-to-nservicebus/) we explored how different services can communicate using messages, including how to publish events that can be processed by multiple subscribing services. This is a great start, but there are some cases where simple message handling is not sufficient.

The [lesson on publishing events](/tutorials/intro-to-nservicebus/4-publishing-events/) hinted at this type of scenario: the **Shipping** service can't ship an order until it has successfully received `OrderPlaced` from the **Sales** service *and* `OrderBilled` from the **Billing** service. Normal message handlers don't store any state, so we need a way to keep track of which events have already been received.

In NServiceBus we use a [saga](/nservicebus/sagas/), which is essentially a message-driven state machine, or a collection of message handlers that persist shared state. Sagas represent a business process where multiple related messages can trigger state changes.

Let's get started building a saga right now.

### Exercise

In this exercise we'll continue with the project from the [previous lesson](/tutorials/intro-to-nservicebus/5-retrying-errors/) and extend it with your first NServiceBus Saga to handle the shipping process.

{{NOTE:
**What if I didn't do the previous tutorial?**

No problem. If you're already familiar with sending messages and publish/subscribe with NServiceBus, you can start learning sagas with this tutorial. At the [end of the previous lesson page](/tutorials/intro-to-nservicebus/5-retrying-errors/), click the **Download Completed Solution** button to get started.

//TODO: Link above should be to hash #summary but there's a DocsEngine but preventing deep-linking into tutorials
//TODO: make sure DocsEngine can link stuff from other tutorials instead of forcing users to leave this page and come back.

The solution contains 5 projects. **ClientUI**, **Sales**, **Billing**, and **Shipping** define endpoints that communicate with each other using NServiceBus messages. The **ClientUI** endpoint mimics a web application and is an entry point to the system. **Sales**, **Billing**, and **Shipping** contain business logic related to processing, fulfilling, and shipping orders. Each endpoint references the **Messages** assembly, which contains the classes defining messages exchanged in our system.

Check out the [Introduction to NServiceBus Overview](/tutorials/intro-to-nservicebus/) for a diagram of how the existing code works.

Although NServiceBus only requires .NET Framework 4.5.2, this tutorial assumes at least Visual Studio 2017 and .NET Framework 4.6.1.

We will create a saga in the **Shipping** endpoint that will handle the `OrderPlaced` and `OrderBilled` events. When it receives both, it'll send the `ShipOrder` command to initiate the delivery.

#### Sagas as policies

It's useful to think of sagas as **policies**. After all, the main use for a saga is to decide what to do next when additional incoming messages arrive. Therefore it's useful to use the word **Policy** in a saga's name.

We're going to call this saga **ShippingPolicy** as it defines the policy around shipping an item, namely, that it requires that the order be both *placed* and *billed*.

In our solution, these activities are currently happening in separate handlers. In the **Shipping** endpoint, you should be able to find **OrderPlacedHandler** as well as **OrderBilledHandler**, both logging the fact that their respective messages arrived, but unable to decide what to do next without the help of the other.

The first thing we're going to do is reorganize these handlers into one class named **ShippingPolicy**.

1. In the **Shipping** project, delete **OrderPlacedHandler.cs** and **OrderBilledHandler.cs**.
1. Create a new class called `ShippingPolicy` in the Shipping project, containing a logger and implementing both the `IHandleMessages<OrderBilled>` and `IHandleMessages<OrderBilled>` interfaces, which we'll implement in basically the same way as the classes we deleted:

snippet: EmptyShippingPolicy

We haven't done anything substantial yet, just reorganized two message handlers into one file. But unlike message handlers, sagas require state. Let's build that next.

#### Saga state

Sagas store their state in a class that inherits from `ContainSagaData` which automatically gives it a few properties (including an `Id`) required by NServiceBus. All the saga's data is represented as properties on the saga data class.

NOTE: We could implement `IContainSagaData` instead and create these required properties ourselves, but it's a lot easier to use the `ContainSagaData` convenience class.

We need to track whether or not we've received `OrderPlaced` and `OrderBilled`. The easiest way to do that is with boolean properties.

In the **Shipping** endpoint, let's create a new class called `ShippingPolicyData` that inherits from `ContainSagaData` class, including properties to store information about events that have been received:

snippet: BasicShippingPolicyData

{{NOTE:
**Where do I put the `ShippingPolicyData` class?**

// TODO: Note on internal vs public, depends upon serializer, etc.
}}

To tell the saga what class to use for its data, we inherit from `Saga<TData>` where `TData` is the saga data type. So for the `ShippingPolicy`, we'll inherit from `Saga<ShippingPolicyData>` like this:

snippet: ShippingPolicyAugmentedWithData

The `Saga<TData>` base class requires us to implement an abstract method called `ConfigureHowToFindSaga`. We'll get to this in a minute, but for now we'll just insert a stub so that we can compile:

snippet: EmptyConfigureHowToFindSaga

With the base class in place, NServiceBus makes the current saga data available inside the saga using `this.Data`. Now that we can access the data, we can change each `Handle` method to update the saga data.

1. In the `Handle` method for `OrderPlaced`, add the statement `Data.IsOrderPlaced = true;`.
1. In the `Handle` method for `OrderBilled`, add the statement `Data.IsOrderBilled = true;`.
1. These two methods should now look like this:

snippet: HandleBasicImplementation

Notice we didn't have to worry about loading and unloading this dataâ€”that's done for us. NServiceBus loads the saga state from storage whenever a message related to the particular saga instance is received by an endpoint, and then stores any changes after the message is processed. Later in this lesson we'll explain how NServiceBus can determine saga state based on incoming messages.

NOTE: NServiceBus sagas are templates representing a process. At runtime, there can be multiple active instance, each representing the shipment process for a specific order. You can think about distinction between saga and saga instance as similar to a class and object instance in C#. In this scenario there will be as many `ShippingPolicy` saga instances as there are shipments currently in progress.

Now, how do we determine how to start a saga?

#### How sagas start

//TODO: Consider doing mappings before IAmStartedBy

When NServiceBus receives a message, it first looks for an existing saga that matches the message. If it can't find any related data, it needs to know whether it has permission to create a new instance of the saga. After all, the incoming message may be an out-of-date message for a saga that has already completed its work.

For that reason, we need to tell the saga which message types can start new saga instances. We do that by swapping the `IHandleMessages<T>` interface for `IAmStartedByMessages<T>` instead.

So clearly, because `OrderBilled` is not published until after Billing processes `OrderPlaced`, that means `OrderPlaced` must come first, and therefore, `OrderPlaced` is the only message type that can start our ShippingPolicy, right?

snippet: ShippingPolicyStartedBy1Message

_**Not so fast!**_

In message-driven systems, there's generally no way to guarantee message ordering. This is a lot different than when using HTTP-based method invocation. In traditional synchronous systems we'd expect that messages are received in the same order as they are sent, i.e. `OrderPlaced` should be received by Shipping before `OrderBilled`. 

But what if we're processing multiple messages in parallel? By sheer dumb luck, it's possible that `OrderBilled` may arrive first! If that happened and `OrderBilled` arrived first, it would be discarded, assumed to belong to an already-finished saga. Then `OrderPlaced` would arrive, start a new saga instance, but its partner message would never arrive.

To ensure we are not making assumptions about which message comes first, we need to tell NServicebus that **both** messages can start a new saga instance.

So, let's change our `ShippingPolicy` class so that instead of implementing `IHandleMessages<T>` we implement `IAmStartedByMessages<T>` for **both** messages instead:

snippet: ShippingPolicyStartedBy2Messages

The `IAmStartedByMessages<T>` interface implements the `IHandleMessages<T>` interface already, so we don't need to make any other code changes to make the swap. Now the NServiceBus infrastructure knows that a message of *either* type can create a new saga instance if one doesn't already exist. The `IHandleMessages<T>` interface requires a saga instance to exist *already*. If no matching saga instance is found, then the incoming message will be ignored.

NOTE: See [Sagas Not Found](/nservicebus/sagas/saga-not-found.md) for more details about what happens when NServiceBus can't find a saga instance for a message.

#### Matching messages to sagas

But, wait a minute! How can NServiceBus know that a saga instance already exists for a specific incoming message?

We need to tell our saga how to recognize which messages are related to the same saga instance. When you made the `ShippingPolicy` saga inherit from the `Saga<T>` base class you were required to implement an abstract method provided by the base class: `ConfigureHowToFindSaga`. Now it's time to fill that in.

The `ConfigureHowToFindSaga` method configures mappings between incoming messages and a saga instances based on message properties. In our scenario both `OrderPlaced` and `OrderBilled` events have an `OrderId` property that is a unique order identifier. It's a perfect, natural candidate for correlating messages to saga instances.

The first thing we need to do is to extend the `ShippingPolicyData` class to keep track of the `OrderId` when storing state information:

snippet: ExtendedShippingPolicyData

We define a mapping between an incoming message and saga data in the `ConfigureMapping` method using the `mapper` parameter, using an expression like this:

snippet: ConfigureHowToFindSagaSampleAPI

The first expression `message => message.MessagePropertyName` allows NServiceBus to inspect a message and pull out a property value, the value of `MessagePropertyName`. The second expression `.ToSaga(sagaData => sagaData.SagaPropertyName)` allows NServiceBus to create (in relational database terms) a query similar to the following:

```sql
select * from SagaDataTable
where SagaPropertyName = @MessagePropertyValue
```

In our case, we can use `OrderId` as our **correlation id**. Let's update our `ConfigureHowToFindSaga` method to use `OrderId` as both the message property and saga property:

snippet: ShippingPolicyFinalMappings

{{NOTE:
In the `ToSaga` expression, it's required that every mapped message maps to the same saga data property. In other words, it's not valid to have one message type map to `sagaData.PropertyA` and another message type map to `sagaData.PropertyB`.

Unlike the example here, the same property name doesn't have to be used on the message mapping expression, but it certainly makes everything easier if they all match. It is fairly common, especially when integrating events from different teams, to have different message property names that describe the same fundamental concept.
}}

Our mappings specify that whenever a message of type `OrderPlaced` is received, the infrastructure needs to use the incoming message `OrderId` property value to look up the saga instance with id that matches the given `OrderId`. If the saga instance doesn't exist and the message is configured to create a new one, NServiceBus will use the value of the order it property from the incoming message as a correlation id for the new saga.

##### Auto-population

One thing we **do not** have to worry about is filling in `OrderId` in the saga data. We've already told NServiceBus that `OrderPlaced` and `OrderBilled` can start the saga. We've told it that it should look up data based on the `OrderId` of the incoming message. Because it knows these things, when it creates a new `ShippingPolicyData` it knows what the value of the `OrderId` property should be, and fills it in for us.

So code like this is **not required**:

snippet: ShippingPolicyCorrelationAutoPopulation

Less boilerplate is a good thing. Let's concern ourselves with more important things, like what to do after both `OrderPlaced` and `OrderBilled` have been received.

#### Orders processing and saga completion

Right now the `ShippingPolicy` saga does nothing else other than handling messages and keeping track of which messages have been handled. Once both messages are received we now need to deliver the order.

So first, in the **Messages** project, create a `ShipOrder` command:

snippet: ShippingPolicyShipOrder

Next, let's add a `ProcessOrder` method to the saga to handle the order delivery:

snippet: ShippingPolicyProcessOrder

NOTE: Here we're using `SendLocal()` to send the `ShipOrder` command to the same endpoint that is processing the saga message. This means we don't have to specify any routing rules for the `ShipOrder` command. We could also use `Send()`, but then we would need to define routing rules just as we did in the [introductory tutorial on multiple endpoints](/tutorials/intro-to-nservicebus/3-multiple-endpoints/), where we defined a route in the **ClientUI** endpoint to send `PlaceOrder` commands to the **Sales** endpoint.

/TODO: Previous paragraph should link to hash #exercise-sending-to-another-endpoint but appears to be a DocsEngine bug preventing that

In the `ProcessOrder` method we check if both messages have been received. In such case the saga will send a message to deliver the order. For this specific `OrderId` the shipment process is now completed. We don't need that saga instance anymore, so it can be safely deleted by invoking the `MarkAsComplete` method.

Now, let's modify each of our `Handle` methods so that they call `ProcessOrder` instead of returning `Task.CompletedTask`:

snippet: ShippingPolicyFinalHandleWithProcessOrder

We also want to be able to handle the `ShipOrder` command we're sending from the saga. In the **Shipping** endpoint, create a new handler class named `ShipOrderHandler` to do that:

snippet: EmptyShipOrderHandler

#### Saga persistence

Before being able to fully run the solution and test if the `ShippingPolicy` saga is working as expected you need to configure 1 more things: *Saga persistence*.

Saga state needs to be persisted, so we need to configure the **Shipping** endpoint with a chosen persistence. In the `Program` class where there is the endpoint configuration code add the following line after the transport configuration:

snippet: ShippingEndpointConfigLearningPersistence

The snippet above is configuring the endpoint to use `LearningPersistence` designed for testing and development. It stores data on the disk in a folder in the executable path. In production use one of [our production-level persistences](/persistence/#available-persistences).


#### Running the solution

// TODO: Needs to show some output

You can now press <kbd>F5</kbd> and test the `ShippingPolicy` saga. By sending a new order from the ClientUI endpoint you should see the following message flow:

* The `PlaceOrder`command is sent from ClientUI to Sales
* Sales publishes the `OrderPlaced` event that is handled by Billing and Shipping
* Billing processes the payment and publishes the `OrderBilled` event
* Shipping handles `OrderPlaced` and `OrderBilled` using the `ShippingPolicy` saga
* When both are handled by the saga, the `ShipOrder` command is sent
