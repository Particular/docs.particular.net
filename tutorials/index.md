### [NServiceBus Step-by-step](nservicebus-step-by-step/)

Learn the basics of NServiceBus, from sending messages between message endpoints to using publish/subscribe. In five short step-by-step lessons, you'll build a back-end for a retail e-commerce system. You'll learn how to send asynchronous messages between processes, how to use the publish/subscribe pattern to decouple business processes, and the advantages of using reliable messaging to enable automatic retries after processing failures.

### [NServiceBus Sagas](nservicebus-sagas/)

Learn to master NServiceBus sagas to model complex, long-running business processes. Learn how to model saga data, show how messages are correlated to the saga, how to use timeouts to model time in your business processes, and how to effectively integrate with third-party systems. Each of the saga lessons can be done in any order you like.

### [Message replay](message-replay/)

One of the most powerful features of NServiceBus is the ability to replay a message that has failed. Often, this type of failure can be introduced by a bug that isn't found until the code is deployed. When this happens, many errors can flood into the error queue all at once.

In this tutorial, see how to roll back to an older version of an endpoint, and then replay the failed messages through proven code. This allows you to take the time to properly troubleshoot and fix the issue before attempting a new deployment.

### [Monitoring NServiceBus demo walkthrough](monitoring-demo/)

This standalone demo contains all of the platform components, preconfigured to work together. The package also contains a sample solution that you can run in conjunction with the metrics walkthrough to explore each of the metrics being reported and how they are related.

### [Monitoring NServiceBus tutorial](monitoring-setup/)

A step-by-step guide that shows how to configure the Particular Service Platform and your solution in order to monitor your system.
